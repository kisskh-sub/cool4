Li Zixuan, congratulations

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.000
on becoming president
of Haiqing Tea Merchants Association.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.040
Congratulations.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.160
The association sent this

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.320
to you this morning.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.280
Look.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.960
Li Zixuan is appointed...

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.400
What's wrong? Too thrilled to speak?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.040
Exactly.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.360
Young Master?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.040
What's wrong?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.360
What's wrong?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.600
Young Master!

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.960
Xiaotang!

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.880
I'm here.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.520
Xiaotang!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.560
I'm here.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.000
- Zixuan.
- Xiaotang.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.040
I'm here!

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.040
Ning An.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.640
Send someone

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.600
to get a physician!

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.720
Yes!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.200
Come.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.440
Be careful.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.600
Be careful.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.520
Zixuan.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.800
What's wrong with Zixuan's eyes?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.200
I've consulted physicians,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.120
but none

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.240
could diagnose.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.680
You know something, right?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600
Tell me.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.400
Is this related to the game?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.360
Don't panic.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.600
How can I not panic?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.160
What is this?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.480
Speak up! What is this?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.080
I once believed

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.600
that everyone's fate in this world

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.400
was predetermined.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.120
But I never expected

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.440
that fate could change.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.840
A person without feelings

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.840
could open up

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.440
to another one.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.640
A person without affection

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.040
could plant seeds
of love for another one.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.400
What has happened shows

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.040
that both your destinies
have transformed.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.920
So,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120
from the very beginning,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.520
your fates weren't tied to the Top Tea.

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:58.080
(Missions)

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.360
We've accomplished the missions

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.520
required of us.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.200
Candlelight illuminates
what eyes can see,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.400
revealing only surface truths.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.280
To see deeper

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.400
requires following your heart.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.840
Close your eyes.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.440
Let your inner light guide your vision.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.720
(In this world,)

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.440
(things change,)

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.480
(and lives change.)

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.120
(Love exists. In the sixth year
of Yuanfeng era,)

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.560
(Xiaotang, Li Zixuan's wife,)

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.920
(for some reason,)

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.840
(repeatedly saved Zixuan's life.)

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.600
(Karma changed.)

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.000
(Fate changed.)

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.840
(The couple sowed their own seeds,)

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.640
(thus reaping their own harvest.)

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.120
(Wei Xiaotang saved Li Zixuan.)

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.960
(She fell in love.)

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.880
(It happens naturally.)

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.520
(She risked her own life)

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.920
(to protect Li Zixuan)

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.680
(until karma is balanced.)

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.240
(From whence it came)

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.440
(to whence it returns,)

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.480
(Li Zixuan's forbidden longing
for Wei Xiaotang)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.560
(produced love.)

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.800
(He loves her)

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.680
(wholeheartedly)

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.920
(until debts were repaid.)

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.520
(Throughout it all,)

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.880
(he follows his heart.)

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.800
(Thus,)

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.680
(the couple fell in love.)

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.880
(Apply their strengths,)

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.560
(and gain mutual recognition.)

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.000
(They got rid of Uncle.)

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.080
(This is a joint effort.)

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.800
(They won the tea competition.)

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.800
(This is a shared triumph.)

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.400
(They took down Mr. Wang.)

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.560
(This is a life-and-death trial.)

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.840
(They resolved family disputes)

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.760
(and revealed Mother's malice,)

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.960
(making the couple relieved.)

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.200
You made a contract.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.520
I believed

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.800
that you were meant to make the Top Tea.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.960
But I never expected

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.280
that your true trial

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.760
wouldn't be the perilous path
to victory,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.960
but a contract
of letting go of each other.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.920
Love is selfish,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.960
yet true devotion is selfless.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.680
You are

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.080
selfishly possessive of each other.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.040
Meanwhile,
you two selflessly let go of each other.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.200
This paradoxical entanglement

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.000
is your true destiny.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.400
Zixuan's blindness
is merely the beginning.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.480
He defied his fate

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.560
and selfishly kept you by his side.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160
He will be gone ultimately.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.920
To save him,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.040
you must leave,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.160
selflessly letting go of him.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.800
Then,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.880
all memories
between you and Zixuan will vanish.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.680
Time will rewind to your wedding night.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.160
He will forget everything about you

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.840
and marry the original Wei Xiaotang,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.640
living happily ever after.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.200
This is the seed of fate you've sown.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.680
Having tasted the fruit of love,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.680
you must now
accept the bitter harvest of separation.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.800
Xiaotang.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.120
You're back.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.600
I'm home.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.600
Could you

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.440
look at the color of this tea?

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.080
It's good.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.920
Actually,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.720
I don't have to master tea making

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.240
as long as I have you.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.360
Rest assured,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.240
I'll help you restore your sight.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.800
I was just out

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.200
to find you an excellent physician.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.160
He'll come tomorrow,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.520
and you'll regain your vision soon.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.760
What's wrong with you?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.760
Xiaotang.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.400
What inspired you

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.720
to invite us for drinks

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.920
without Zixuan?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320
Acting all mysterious.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.600
Well, I'll be frank with you all.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.840
This is yours.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.120
Here you are.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.520
This...

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.280
This is my development plan

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.160
for the tea estate.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.880
I wrote it for Miss Niaoniao

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.640
and Mr. Qi.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.280
Plans for Gu's Tea Estate?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.200
Oh, Zimo,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.080
read this carefully.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.720
Niaoniao,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.640
watch him.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.120
Got it?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.000
Xiaotang, you can nag me
at home, not outside.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.840
I'll read this at home.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.040
Moreover,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.440
you know Zixuan's recent mood

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.600
and condition.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.120
So, when you're free,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.680
you keep Zixuan company.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.840
It would do him good.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.880
He doesn't need our company.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.240
He only needs you.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.480
Exactly, Xiaotang.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.600
As long as you're with Zixuan,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.320
whatever challenges arise,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.640
he'll overcome them all.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.880
Right?

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:21.880
Come on.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.080
Xiaotang.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.920
Let us toast you.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.200
Here.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.680
Whether in ten years or twenty years,

as long as you're here,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.960
we'll fear nothing.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.080
Then tonight, let's get drunk!

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.000
- Let's get drunk!
- Let's get drunk!

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.120
Bottoms up!

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.000
The food is getting cold. Let's eat.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.000
Alright.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.800
Xiaotang, you eat.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.400
It looks good.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.080
Here, Zimo.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.720
You're a grown man.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.800
You don't have to be sober tonight.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320
- Drink up, Zimo!
- Let's drink.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.440
Here.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.760
Zimo, I can outdrink even you.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.280
Where is Xiaotang?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.200
Where is she?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.080
Where is Xiaotang?

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.640
Where did she go?

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.720
When exactly did she leave?

00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:41.216

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.240
Tomorrow our shop opens.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.720
I want you to invite all scholars here

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.600
to come.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.320
I'll treat them to free milk tea.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.960
Now that the major issues
are mostly resolved,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.440
our getting closer...

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.600
(It was just a minor issue.)

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.560
(Is it?)

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.800
(This is between the two of us.)

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.240
(Why is an outsider involved?)

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.360
(Fine, I'll listen to you from now on.)

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.640
Miss, have some fried cakes?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.560
Give it a try!

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.280
(How is it?)

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.280

(wishes come true.)

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.680
Then I must make a wish.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.080
I wish

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.120
to win the Top Tea title this year!

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.720
But if we earn the Top Tea title,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.480
you'll leave.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.440
Never mind.

(I couldn't go back today.)

(You're selfishly possessive
of each other.)

(Meanwhile, you two
selflessly let go of each other.)

(He defied his fate)

(and selfishly kept you by his side.)

(He will be gone ultimately.)

(To save him,)

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.640
(you must leave,)

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.840
(selflessly letting go of him.)

(Then,)

(all memories

(Time will rewind
to your wedding night.)

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.920
(He will forget everything about you)

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.440
(and marry the original Wei Xiaotang,)

The weather is getting cold.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.680
So I ordered the servants

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.200
to make you more clothes.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.440
When they're ready,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.800
you can try them.

Alright.

Freshly fried cakes!

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.080
What's wrong?

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.520
Sir, want some fried cakes?

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.880
Zixuan.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.440
This is street food.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.560
We've never tried it.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.880
Who knows if it's clean?

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480
Somehow,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.840
this fried cake

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.240
smells familiar.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.920
As if I shared this

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.360
with someone before.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.920
But I can't find

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.600
that person again.
