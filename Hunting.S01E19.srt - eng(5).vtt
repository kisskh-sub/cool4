[Episode 19]

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.150
Steady.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.500
On my back.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.390
One, two.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.610
Let's go.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.630
Open the door.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.430
Open the door!

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.940
Careful.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.560
Watch his head.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.960
Okay.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.490
His head.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.860
Alright.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.000
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.930
Hello, Chief Fang.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.610
Where are his injuries?

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.170
Here and here.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.510
A bit serious.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.730
Was your head broken or what?

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.860
Why did you turn off your phone?

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.880
In denial of what you did, huh?

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.080
Watch your attitude.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.350
Yang Yipeng,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.150
you've forgotten

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.280
you're a police officer, haven't you?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.870
How dare you act the hero?

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.750
You're lucky that nothing huge

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.800
happened today.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.880
If you had killed Mou Sen

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.680
or he had killed you today,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.400
I would be too embarrassed
to stay in my position as chief.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.430
I just wanted to catch him with my hands.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.430
Who would've known he'd arrive early?

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.360
You think I don't know

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.590
what you were off to?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.520
Smarty-pants,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.410
you were hoist with your own petard.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.430
Tell me.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.050
Last night, why did you not report

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.840
Mou Sen's whereabouts?

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.040
How was I supposed to do that?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.140
Would you have let me go
if I had reported?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.200
So you knew it then.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.280
Listen up,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.180
if you had done anything
out of line to Mou Sen,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.770
I would've handcuffed you myself!

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.600
Chief Fang,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.460
don't be mad.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.840
He's spent 3 years on this manhunt.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.470
His choice was understandable, right?

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.600
So you knew that too?

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.779
You're an experienced officer.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.360
From a professional standpoint,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.110
this drug cook hasn't been caught yet

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.190
exactly because of your reckless behavior.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.440
Was it the right way to work a case?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.170
That was more like a gang fight.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.960
According to the discipline,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.240
whatever heinous crimes he committed,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.830
he should be put through
the legal process,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.290
and not be punished by you.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.440
For the good of the investigation,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.190
today,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.830
I didn't plan to arrest him at all.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.790
Why not?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.830
Why didn't you arrest him?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.000
You grumpy dud!

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.430
What do you think the reason was?

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.430
Use your brain

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.600
and think why I let him go!

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.980
I meant to use Mou Sen

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.210
to infiltrate the Platinum Road.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.190
This hotbed of crimes on the dark web

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.710
is our ultimate target!

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.180
Don't you understand?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.450
We're now trying to find

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.830
all the drug traffickers there
through Mou Sen.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.070
If we caught him now,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.090
how could we proceed with the plan?

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.950
I've said many times

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.310
anti-drug campaigns are not
just about arresting individuals.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.190
It's a no-brainer.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.460
Don't you understand?

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.080
Always the same speech.

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:36.460
Mou Sen

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.920
was just a bait.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.210
I meant for you

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.060
to approach him.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.880
But now, it seems

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.120
we have to come up with

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.540
new plans.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.430
Chief Fang, sorry.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.360
I've let you down.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.920
All my hard work in the past 3 years
has gone down the drain.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.430
I apologize to you!

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.260
Down the drain?

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.280
That's not true!

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.430
The point is we can't arrest Mou Sen now.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.850
Do you still not get it?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.240
It's part of a major strategy.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.070
Understood?

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.350
I know you're still not convinced.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.610
Try to process it then!

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.800
Yang Yipeng,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.970
now that your cover has been blown,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.800
this covert intelligence mission
ends here.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.950
You'll either go home for a rest,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.410
or be reinstated as a member
of the special task force.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.460
Mull it over. Make your choice.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.920
What were you doing?

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.230
You should've explained to him,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.920
right?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.280
What are you trying to say?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.920
I'm saying,
why not take the option to rejoin

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.310
the force?

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.370
And be your deputy?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.120
You know that's not what I mean.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.650
Then stop talking about it!

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.040
Last time, you left without eating.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.140
Let's make up for it now.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.830
Thank you.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.490
What's to thank me for?

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.360
This is not wine,

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.140
but still,
cheers to finally catching Mou Sen.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.800
Hello?

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.650
Okay, I got it.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.159
What's wrong?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.970
Mou Sen wasn't caught.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.270
That couldn't be right.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.120
I arranged a meeting for him.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.250
He promised he'd definitely be there.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.960
He went to your place early.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.520
By the time our people arrived,
he had left.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.310
What about Mr. Zhen?

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.360
Mr. Zhen was supposed to be there too.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.290
He knew the plan.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.480
Officer Yang would like to
explain to you in person.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.000
He asked me to take you to him.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.720
What Officer Yang?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.250
I'm talking about Mr. Zhen.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.760
Mr. Zhen is Officer Yang.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.480
[In loving memory]

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.550
This is...

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.840
He was my father.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.940
This monument is for unnamed heroes.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.790
Those buried here
all sacrificed their lives

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.250
in combating drug crimes.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.030
[In loving memory]

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.080
Though not all heroes' names,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.360
portraits,

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.200
or birthdates are presented here,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.420
we would always remember them
in our hearts.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.800
Captain Wu,

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.470
I'm sorry.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:26.550
[In loving memory]

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.410
I once promised

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.160
to never return to the force
until I caught Mou Sen.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.620
But I have to go back on my word.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.840
After being "Mr. Zhen" for nearly 3 years,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.240
I feel like I've almost forgotten

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.970
how to be a real police officer.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.730
It's time I rejoined the force.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.440
But don't worry.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.860
I swear I will catch Mou Sen.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.240
Duozai, wait.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.670
Sorry.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.580
I couldn't keep my promise to you.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.100
Why did you fail to arrest Mou Sen?

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.960
The situation changed.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.700
Duozai is leaving Nanzhou.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.610
Where are you going?

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.600
I want to take Hao away from here

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.400
and start a new life.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.240
How are you going to do that?

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.120
Four-Eyes is in Mou Sen's hands now.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.450
How do you take him away?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:49.960
How?

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.830
Duozai, think about it.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.910
Actually, we have the same target,

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.970
and that's Mou Sen.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.360
Uncle Ma

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.550
and Zhi'an's father,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.950
who used to be my captain,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.490
were both killed
by drug dealers like Mou Sen.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.520
We can team up.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480
Do you have a plan?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.790
Mou Sen wants to join the Platinum Road.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.450
He desperately needs you now.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.040
What's up?

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.870
He can't do that.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.600
Why can't he?

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.320
We're not catching drug dealers
for personal vendettas.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.000
Making him approach Mou Sen now

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.160
is getting him in danger.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.550
He'll definitely raise suspicion.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:33.950
Do you have a better plan?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:34.840
Do you?

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.320
Didn't Zhan Cui meet a tragic end

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.720
because you went find her?

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.630
She could've fared better.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.030
That was a different matter.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.360
Mou Sen is still at large now

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.160
exactly because you went rogue.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.320
I know you're anxious.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.160
So am I.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.200
But we can't send him to a death trap

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.320
in order to solve the case, can we?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.790
Duozai makes his own decisions.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.590
I can't force him to do anything.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.080
Got it?

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.470
Any decision?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.320
I can't leave this city alone.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.270
But I don't want you to take this risk.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.150
Can you let him think it over?

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.960
No!

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.970
Duozai, you're coming with me.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.150
Wu Zhi'an, you've forgotten everything

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.610
I said to you, haven't you?

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.240
Wu Zhi'an!

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.270
Hello?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.900
What's Duozai's idea?

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.200
I think he might get onboard.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.720
Good.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.680
I've reported to Chief Fang.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.960
If Ma Duozai goes back to Mou Sen
in the current situation,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.620
it'll be hard for him
to gain the latter's trust.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.240
I'll seek alternative options.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.100
What other options do we have now?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.810
Can anyone guarantee
any choice to be 100% safe?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.440
Thank you, Zhi'an.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.450
No one has shown me
this much care for a long time.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.860
What?

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.440
I was saying...

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.350
You also want to catch Mou Sen soon,
right?

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.120
But I can't sacrifice an innocent life

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.600
just in order to catch him.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.100
If I did that,
I'd have a guilty conscience forever.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.330
Mou Sen will definitely
be punished one day.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.500
Your father's death wouldn't be in vain.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.150
This is the place.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.120
Right here?

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.750
Yes.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.010
When are you leaving?

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.120
I have a relative

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.270
who owns a factory in Ningcheng.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.640
If you want,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.100
you can start a new life there.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.080
Do you...

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.770
really want me to leave?

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.910
Mou Sen hasn't been caught yet.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.600
Nanzhou is a dangerous place for you.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.600
I'm worried they might go after you.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.470
I can stay.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.000
I'm not afraid of him.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.930
Please don't do anything foolish.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.080
Are you saying it

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.090
from a cop's perspective,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.670
or

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.180
a friend's?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.790
Either way, it's not worth the risk.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.870
My supervisor has the same opinion.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.120
Well...

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.150
Maybe I can figure out a way to trick him

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.480
into going there. Then...

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.060
Don't.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.360
It's time you got out of this mess.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.960
You know?

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.970
I need you to make a vow to me.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.270
You must swear to never ever

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.480
act as an informant.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.660
Will you believe me

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440
if I make that vow?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.240
I will.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.790
Okay.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.680
You have my word then.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.650
Are you going back now?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.320
Yes.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.560
I'll pack up my stuff.

Keep yourself safe.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:15.840
Don't worry.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.470
I don't think he dares to go there again.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.690
I'll be fine.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.200
Goodbye then.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.790
Let me know when you make up your mind.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.120
I'll contact that relative for you.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.840
Sure.

Are you mistaken?

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.329
How could Duozai possibly betray us?

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.200
There must've been a misunderstanding.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.130
Misunderstanding?

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.530
What misunderstanding?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.830
Did he ask the police to come?

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.970
He used to talk about

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.260
calling the police

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.550
and turning himself in.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.160
Did he do it?

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.420
He was capable of that!

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.350
If he did work for the police,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.830
we would've been arrested already!

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.200
You have a death wish or what?

He was deceived by Mr. Zhen.

We really didn't know Mr. Zhen was a cop.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.560
There's no way
Duozai will contact you again.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:21.820
And you!

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.680
I reminded you many times, didn't I?

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.590
What is Duozai like?

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.960
A wolf that can't be tamed!

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.080
and be blindly compassionate?

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.700
You thought you were doing charity work?

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.590
Lucky you,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.000
for reaching that place early.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.350
Or you would've been arrested by the cops!

Isn't Mr. Zhen a police officer?

Why did he hit you so hard?

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.080
He was there for revenge.

This young man called me Mother
the moment he came.

You should've told me
you were bringing your boyfriend home.

When did you start dating?

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.520
Some time ago.

Come on in. Don't just stand there.

How long has Mother been like this?

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.070
The diagnosis was confirmed
right after you left.

Her condition has deteriorated badly

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.080

I'm the only one she can recognize now.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.740
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.200
Would it have made any difference?

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.670
Would you have come home?

Actually, I know you came back

Come have some tea.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.930
Very tasty.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.250
who never liked studying.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.550
He enjoyed playing sticks and toy guns.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.550
Later on, he became a policeman.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.110
The strict discipline of the force

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.040
disallowed him to often come home.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.370
I know he must've died
in the line of duty.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.810
His sacrifice was for the country,

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.920

You're just like my son.

He ate unpeeled apples too.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.320
How come the more I look at you,
the more similar you seem to my son?

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.350

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.280
You're committing a capital offense!

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.210
Do you know that?

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.820
What do those drug addicts
have to do with me?

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.110
I don't care about them at all.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.140
And I don't need your care either.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.700
I can use stamps

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.250
whenever I feel like it.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.720
It's none of your business!

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:32.920
Fine.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.590
I'll take you for a drug test.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.050
Move it!

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.070
If you're tested positive,
I'll call the police!

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:40.550
Duozai!

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.410
Are you really sending me to jail?

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.330
Don't you forget

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.450
you've been a mule more than once.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.810
If I am to be put behind bars,

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.330
you'll end up the same!

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.140
Okay.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.260
Let's go to prison together.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:04.990
Come with me.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:05.710
Duozai!

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.320
Move it!

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.480
You're out of your mind!

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.360
Act crazy if you want to.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.560
Why drag me into this?

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.820
Because you're like a brother to me!

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.650
My father already passed away!

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:19.730
I...

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.620
I can't...

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.540
I can't lose you too.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.920
I can't lose you too!

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.030
I promise not to cause you any trouble
after I get out.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.390
We'll live a good life.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.030
Don't you want to go to school?

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.030
I'll provide for you.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.920
The three of us

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.710
will be a happy and harmonious family.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:42.150
That's right!

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.630
Let's drink!

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.070
Come on.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:43.440
Cheers.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.110
A family?

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.030
I haven't agreed

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.850
to let him be your godson.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:46.630
You two are close like brothers.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.280
Aren't we family now?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:47.910
We are!

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.920
Come on.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.530
And you think I can lose you?

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.560
Since we stole that car,

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.730
this mess we're in has been getting

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.590
bigger and bigger like a rolling snowball.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.280
It's out of our control now.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.030
Hasn't Hao

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.840
replied to our texts yet?

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.230
I told you this must be a trap.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.280
Thank God
we didn't deliver the samples ourselves.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.190
Poor Duozai.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.230
He became cannon fodder.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.760
Haipeng.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.410
Haipeng, come look at this!

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.840
Look at what?

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.260
Our goods.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.640
Our goods?

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.360
They're now for sale online.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.710
That means we've succeeded.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.700
We'll make a lot of money!

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.560
Look, our goods have sold out.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.200
[Sorry, products have sold out]

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.800
I can't wait to buy a sports car.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.500
I'll sell that old junker of mine.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:41.840
Hello.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.280
Hello.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.030
I'm Andy.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.740
Jiamin, I'll buy you a house.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.230
Jiamin...

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.000
Hello.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.440
They've sold out
Does it mean we'll be rich?

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.530
Lower your voices.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.220
Excuse me.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:06.070
Hi,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.960
this is Luo Yuansu.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.240
As far as I know,
your name is not Luo Yuansu.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:12.600
In fact,

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.840
you should have the same name
as Mou Haidong.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.770
So I'm guessing your surname is...

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.360
Mou.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:19.150
Yeah.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.990
My name is...

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.360
Mou Sen.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.090
Sorted it.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.840
Only Mou Haidong's son

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.160
can make pink ice.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.620
I never expected your stamps

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.230
to be quite so good.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.670
Thank you.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.870
It's not me praising you.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.440
The market has spoken.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.440
You're welcome to join the Platinum Road.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.640
Hope we can have a happy cooperation.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.290
I have one request.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.560
What's that?

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.240
Mou Haidong had an old account

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.670
on the Platinum Road,

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.400
which is stolen by Xin Sheng He.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.410
I would like to have it back.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.840
That account has been changed.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.900
And it complies with our procedures.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.670
It's not my place to interfere.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:08.390
In fact,

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.630
I should say that it's your fault
for not protecting your account.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.850
It has my old man's money for me.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.020
The most valuable thing you have right now

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.450
is your skills.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.030
Keep producing good products
for our platform,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.040
and you can be rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.460
Now, let me get this straight.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.680
It provides

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.680
raw materials

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:33.990
and sales.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.810
Don't you worry about that.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.190
Suppliers from all over the globe

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.880
can join the Platinum Road.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.570
About the operation,

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.250
your hacker friend can
learn about it soon.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.440
He's pretty smart, so it's all good.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:51.600
I'm curious.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.840
How he get in touch with you?

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.960
He attacked our server.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.510
Didn't work,

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.170
but it caused us some trouble.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.210
He hacked you?

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.750
Very few hackers
can identify our vulnerabilities.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:06.840
So,

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.520
he caught my attention.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.320
I looked through
your application materials,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.450
fast tracked the application process

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.400
and told you
to send the products directly.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.710
My apologies.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.850
I didn't know he'd act so radical.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.550
Extreme is a quality

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:26.810
Anyway,

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.330
now, it's up to you and your partner.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.570
Maybe one day,

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.070
we can work even closer together.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.770
Looking forward to it.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.440
You do have a choice.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.040
You can leave Pigpen Boy.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.710
But what can I after I leave him?

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.430
Someone offered me a job in Ningcheng.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:06.790
A job again.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.570
I'm sorry, Duozai.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.250
I don't want to stick with you anymore.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.460
I hate
the idea of being an employee all my life.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.900
But at least you can lead an honest life

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.760
with a clear conscience that way.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.440
Do you remember the time when you

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.890
saved up money to go abroad?

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.450
I remember that.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.360
You're just like how you were back then—

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.970
down-to-earth,

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.570
and motivated to work hard.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.150
The only difference now

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.580
is that your father
is no longer a burden to you.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.950
You should go.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.430
Live for yourself.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.960
It's just that...

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:22.730
It's just...

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.140
that we seem to have stepped
on different paths.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.350
I'm grateful to you

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:37.980
for not calling the police.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.720
When I...

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.300
become rich, I'll go find you, Duozai.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:05.730
[Bingzhou Seafood]

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.130
Hello, Mr. Luo.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.360
Duozai is leaving Nanzhou.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:10.600
Where to?

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.410
Ningzhou, where he'll work in a factory.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.430
I don't want to be a loser my whole life.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:19.030
So I talked him into leaving.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.800
By the way,

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.480
why aren't you guys
in the arcade building?

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:27.630
The situation is tense.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.090
We went out for a breather.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:29.870
Okay.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.460
I'll come find you.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.550
Hao,

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.010
I promised Duozai
not to let you work for me anymore.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.660
I...

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.580
I make my own life decisions.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.160
I've learned a lot from you.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.490
I can be your assistant.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.200
As long as you let me stick around,

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.730
I'll be glad to do anything.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.930
Are you sure you'll do anything for me?

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.050
Yes.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.280
You should go with Duozai,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.690
and get back to the way you were.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.000
How am I supposed to

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.400
get back to the way I were?

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.220
I don't want to go back

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:10.590
Neither can I go back now.
