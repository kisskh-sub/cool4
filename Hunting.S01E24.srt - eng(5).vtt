Could that be the entrance?

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.920
We can't blow it up.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.140
It's too dangerous.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.370
This is Yang Yipeng.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.480
Officers inside, please respond
if you can hear me.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.140
Please respond if you hear me.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.670
Copy that, Captain Yang.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.220
What's going on in there?

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.910
The space is very confined here.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.710
And there's no air circulation.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.440
We're getting short of oxygen.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.200
Conserve your energy.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.530
Wait for rescue.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.590
Understood.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.340
Hack their communication channel.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.870
Yes, sir.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.590
Hello.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.040
Uninvited guests.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.530
Who is this?

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.300
I'm Andy.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.520
So I'm going to say this only once.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.640
You and all your
ground forces retreat now.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.240
Otherwise,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.170
I can't guarantee the safety of your pals.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.810
Let me be crystal clear about this.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.170
You attacked my base.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.420
And the only things you're going to find

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.900
are their dead bodies.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.790
Andy.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.860
We can retreat.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.630
But you must release the officers first.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.030
Release the officers first!

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.560
You're not in a position
to negotiate with me.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.040
Captain Yang.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.650
Don't back down.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.610
Don't negotiate with them.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.850
We're not afraid to make sacrifices.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.190
Captain Yang.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.390
We have two options now.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.500
Either we blow it open,

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.330
or we retreat.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:10.910
If we retreat,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.240
at least we can ensure
the safety of the fellows inside.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.010
But if we force
our way in with explosives,

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.000
there will definitely be casualties.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.800
Captain Yang.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.920
Blow it up.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.060
What are you talking about?

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.000
The air inside is thin.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.120
They won't last much longer.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.910
But we don't have any other options now.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.000
We've been following
this lead for so long.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.750
We can't lose it now.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.670
Is solving the case more important,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.530
or the lives of the people inside?

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.880
I promised my Master.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.160
I would take him to complete the mission.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.420
Here's the case.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.480
I'll consult with higher-ups first.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.120
We have another plan.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.740
No need!

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.880
Give them the gas.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.630
Understood.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.450
Zhi'an.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.880
How's the situation on your end?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.260
We've received orders from above.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.280
For your safety,

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.480
we need to evacuate for now.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.810
We'll evacuate for now.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:50.590
Captain Yang.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.950
We're prepared to make sacrifices.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.370
Duozai is still inside.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.840
Don't give up.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.050
Zhi'an,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.830
is that you?

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.000
Duozai.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:02.990
Duozai.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.240
Can you hear me?

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:05.910
It's Zhi'an.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.440
Why is that rat still here?

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.920
Is he still talking to the policewoman?

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.430
We'll go find them.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:15.240
Split up.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.880
If we can't find them,

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.160
we'll all die.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.000
Okay?

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.920
Come on.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:20.970
Come on.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.080
I'm sorry.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.640
You fell into a trap because of me.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.700
You've done great.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.740
Take care of yourself.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.130
Wait for Captain Yang to rescue you.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.180
You sound weak.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.860
Duozai, don't worry about me.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.960
Quickly find a place

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.990
to hide yourself.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:38.400
Come out.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:53.620
Hang in there.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.570
I'll find a way to save you.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.950
The person you need
to help is Captain Yang.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.080
If they can get in,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.420
we still have a chance.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.550
Duozai! Duozai!

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.410
Can you hear me?

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.600
Duozai!

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:08.660
Duozai!

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.160
The distance is too far. Signal's weak.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.880
Basement. Basement.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.020
Duozai!

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.830
Today you're destined

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.690
to die here.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.540
Then we'll die together.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.540
Go! Go! Go!

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.540
Hurry! Hurry!

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.400
Zhi'an!

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:04.860
Zhi'an!

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.760
Find a place to hide.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.380
I'll rescue you soon.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.320
Duozai!

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.790
Duozai, don't worry about me.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.640
Quickly find somewhere

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640
to hide yourself.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.450
I've been hiding all along.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.170
I don't want to hide anymore.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.370
I want to be a real assassin.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.680
Zhi'an.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.880
These 20-some years
of my life have meant nothing.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.610
Fortunately, I met you.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.730
You gave me a dream.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.960
We've made countless comebacks together.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.930
We'll win this time too.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.390
Duozai, I'm warning you,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.110
don't do anything stupid.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.750
Duozai, answer me!

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.930
Duozai!

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.180
Duozai, can you hear me?

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:52.930
What you've done

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.490
has made me very

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.180
very unhappy.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.910
So now

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.050
I'm going to kill that woman.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.190
Leave her alone!

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.040
Too late.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.810
You'll never see her alive again.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.880
Bastard!

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.500
You'll pay for this.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.080
Andy.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.000
If you dare hurt even one officer inside,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.680
I'm telling you,

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.400
I'll blow this whole place sky high.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.270
Did you hear me?

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.790
Are you threatening me?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.010
This is your final warning.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.900
Aren't the Chinese police afraid of death?

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.510
We just don't want to see our comrades

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.850
die in vain.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.060
I'll say it again.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.070
If you dare touch a single hair on them,

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.440
China's narcotics police

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.270
will repay you double.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.430
Do you understand?

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:34.610
He's bluffing.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.110
I'm not going to let

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.650
anyone threaten me here.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.570
Attention!

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.720
I want them dead.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.030
Go take care of them.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.720
Get me that damn walkie-talkie.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.350
Understood.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.390
Go! Go! Go!

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:24.520
He has gasoline.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.030
That way.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.130
Stop him!

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.930
Will you guys stop him?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.540
Zhi'an!

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.620
Zhi'an!

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.550
You need to stay alive.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.430
Duozai.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.940
Duozai!

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.570
What is he trying to do?

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.110
Mr. Zhen.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.650
It's all up to you now.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.540
Captain Yang, look!

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.330
Everyone, follow me!

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:44.720
Go!

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.620
Come on!

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.670
You want to catch me, don't you?

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:55.490
Come on!

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:56.740
Come at me!

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.060
Don't move!

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.710
Where's Duozai?

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.200
Where is Duozai?

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.070
Talk, now!

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.240
Don't move!

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.440
Come on. Come on.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.160
Don't move!

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:53.900
Where's Mou Sen?

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:55.560
Where is Mou Sen?

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.260
He's already dead.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.070
Duozai.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.310
Can you hear me?

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.210
It's Zhi'an.
