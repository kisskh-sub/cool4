[Hunting]

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.229
[Episode 20]

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.070
The Ancestral Hall stamps

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.870
were released on the Platinum Road

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.870
and sold out

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.340
in less than 3 minutes.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.390
I never thought that cook

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.390
would also get on board

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.890
the Platinum Road ship.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
The factory in Xiangnan
and the music store in Nanzhou

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.070
were both anonymously reported.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.310
Now he suddenly
shows up to steal business.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.640
It's not a coincidence.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.760
I didn't expect he'd hate me this much.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.130
Right now,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.970
I'm actually a little curious

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.710
about what makes his stuff

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.520
so special.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.500
Miss Tang.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.560
Miss Tang.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.560
How does it sound?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.320
Beethoven...

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.350
The deeper he fell,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.210
the more tremendous energy
he could unleash.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.390
Both desperate and powerful,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.860
right?

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.630
But not everyone can be a genius.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.050
Have you seen this?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.190
Ancestral Hall stamps.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.690
Don't know
which small workshop produced them.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.430
How different can LSD stamps be,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.400
Miss Tang?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.310
We've actually come here
to discuss rebuilding the factory.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.390
Try it.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.490
Now.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.790
Try it first, then we'll talk.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.100
Bunch of fools.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.950
Duozai, here.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.210
Are you alright?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.440
I'm fine.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.780
Be careful.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.190
Let me help you.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.310
You don't know how to skate?

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.840
I thought you knew how.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.640
Before coming here,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.440
I practiced a bit.

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.870
If you don't know how, I can teach you.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.270
Sure.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.930
Take it slow.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.430
Okay.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.270
Slowly.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.720
Okay.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.720
Careful!

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.800
Are you alright?

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.770
Take it easy.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.120
Okay.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.560
Fun, isn't it?

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.240
Your drinks.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.000
Thank you.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.510
I've decided

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.800
to leave.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.330
Thank you for recommending that job to me.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.700
Ningcheng is a nice place.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.120
Once you get over there, live well.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.120
Start over.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800
Yes, it's time...

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.409
It's time to start over.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.320
Do you still remember?

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.920
We met here.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.870
And now,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.670
we part here.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.400
Hearing you say it like that,
it does feel rather ceremonial.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.780
I'll toast with cola instead of wine.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.940
Here's to your escape from that mess

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.780
and to your future success.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.290
What about you?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.510
Me?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.360
I definitely want to work hard

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.610
to solve this case.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.600
I'll bring Mou Sen and those drug dealers

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.790
to justice.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.110
Though it sounds like a slogan,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.070
that's genuinely how I feel.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.040
I think you're really cool.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.180
Like you have a halo.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.000
Although it seems

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.640
besides giving you Mou Sen's account,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.080
I couldn't help much.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.360
You've already helped me a lot.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.250
You've finally gotten out.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.200
I just want you to live a peaceful life.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.560
Live peacefully.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.410
Be an ordinary person.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.040
Beautiful.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.720
I'll always remember.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.480
I'll always remember you too.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.909
Meeting you

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.350
is the only good thing

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.130
that's happened to me.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.630
You're making this
sound like a final goodbye.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.320
Ningcheng isn't far from Nanzhou.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.850
We'll see each other often.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.740
We'll keep seeing each other.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.110
What was your childhood dream?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.240
Me?

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.490
I wanted to become Taro Ultraman.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.390
I know.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.720
Isn't that the one
with the purple-red outfit

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.270
and a blade on his head?

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.840
That's Tiga Ultraman.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.200
Taro has three blades on his head.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.750
Three? I was wrong.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.010
Seems every kid has their fantasy phase.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.630
When I was little, I wondered

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.080
how I could join them.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.140
How would you join?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.200
Well,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.440
I'd need to find
a chance to sacrifice myself

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.750
and save others.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.510
They would see it and be moved,

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.510
really touched.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.840
Then they would invite me

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.870
to join them.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.480
That's an interesting idea.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.150
But I was much more childish than you.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.570
Guess who I wanted to marry as a child?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.480
You can't guess, can you?

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.810
I was determined to marry Buzz Lightyear.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.470
So you like that type.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.960
He's my ideal man.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.750
And even now, whenever I have time,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.480
I still go to the amusement park.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.080
He just stands there silently,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.200
and I watch him from a distance.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.530
It makes me feel better.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.090
Don't you think

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.600
those mascots are just people in costumes?

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.080
They're not real.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.600
And the Buzz Lightyear
you saw wasn't real.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.540
But as long as
I believe he's real, then he is.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.570
Heroes don't necessarily
have to save the world.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.790
Look.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.120
Just living your own life well

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.370
and doing your job properly every day.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.480
I think that's
what makes an ordinary hero.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.920
Here's your noodles.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.860
Ma'am, I already paid.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:17.920
Thanks.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.510
Ma'am, one bowl of noodles.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.630
[Duozai]

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.890
Tomorrow morning at 9,

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.080
at the intercity bus station.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.080
I'll wait for you.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:43.940
Who is this?

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.840
It's been a while

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.040
since we met in Xinji.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.290
Miss Tang.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.690
I saw your products.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.200
As soon as they were released
on the Platinum Road,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.730
they sold out immediately.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.150
Compared to Xin Sheng He,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.170
we're nothing special.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.230
You're being too modest.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.370
With your capabilities,

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.630
you could easily compete with me fairly.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.590
There's no need to
play dirty behind my back.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.480
Miss Tang, I don't quite

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.440
understand these words of yours.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.170
So it seems you won't admit

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.520
what you did
to the factory and the music store.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.050
What about you
stealing my family's account?

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.680
Do you admit that?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.490
Then we're even.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.730
Rather than fighting each other,

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.240
why don't we make money together?

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.240
You want to cooperate with me?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.000
You have the craftsmanship,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.200
I have the resources.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.150
If you join forces with me,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.320
the entire Asian market could be ours.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.010
Sounds tempting.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.690
But before we cooperate,

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.720
shouldn't you settle

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.790
what you owe me first?

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.060
If you come to Xinji
and join Xin Sheng He,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.560
I'll return Mou Haidong's account
to you. How's that?

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.540
Miss Tang.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.120
Last time I went to Xinji,

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.000
I almost lost my life.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.550
I don't have that many lives
for you to take.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.200
When you talk like that,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.110
it breaks my heart.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.160
I'm sincerely trying to cooperate,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.760
yet you don't trust me at all.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.350
Return my account first,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.730
then we can talk about trust.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.900
In that case,

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.760
there's nothing to discuss.

Have you thought about Uncle Ma?

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.560
You promised to avenge him.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.440
After his sacrifice,

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.480
we haven't even accomplished that

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.280
and you're already backing out?

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.210
You're not even as good as Hao.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.240
Hao has become what he is now.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.450
Isn't that because of you?

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.170
The path Hao is taking

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.250
is different from ours.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.000
Yes.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.010
He's different from us.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.340
I should have seen it clearly.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.800
All of you have been lying to me.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.930
Everyone's been deceiving me.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.730
Now even Hao is lying to me.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.460
Duozai.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.570
Whatever decisions Four-Eyes Hao made,

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.430
I never forced him.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.110
Because I simply don't care.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.020
But you're different.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.150
So I'll make

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.900
this decision for you.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.700
Drink it,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.480
so that you can never go back.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.790
Untie me!

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.310
Untie me now!

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.930
Bring Hao back to me.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.030
Sen.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.250
Finally made up your mind.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.670
If this guy hesitates again,

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.130
get rid of him.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.340
Who said they don't drink, huh?

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.210
This is unprecedented.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.230
By the way, I have something to tell you.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.460
Hu has

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.510
introduced a supplier to me.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.440
I'll go talk to them.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.720
Don't we already have
suppliers on the Platinum Road?

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.000
It's cheaper.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.250
We can make more profit.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.640
Come on.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.080
This isn't a trap, is it?

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.220
No way.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.040
Don't worry.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.030
The number you have dialed is powered off.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.000
Please try again later.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.210
I bought some food you like.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.510
I'm sorry.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.920
Why did you

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.960
betray me?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.160
He said

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.630
that as long as you came back,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.120
I could come back too.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.960
Only together

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.070
can we accomplish great things.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.240
Duozai.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.640
I know.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.970
I've always been just an accessory to you.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.200
Without you, I'm nothing.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.780
And if I hadn't stolen those drugs,

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.510
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.400
I know you're angry and want to hit me.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.550
You don't have to.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.550
I'll do it for you.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.240
Duozai.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.240
I'm begging you.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.240
Work with Mr. Luo.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.440
I'll do anything.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:42.580
I just

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.190
don't want to go back to my old life.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.240
Do you understand?

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.920
We'll...

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.500
We don't have to live in hardship anymore.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.280
We'll take planes.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.610
We'll go to many places.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:16.670
You used it?

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.920
You used it too?

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.770
Why did you use it too?

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.600
Who made you use it?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.200
Hao.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:22.830
Hao.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.070
Let's go take a plane.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.660
Let's go.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.510
Let's go.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.370
Let's go there.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.330
Why did you use it too?

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.520
Duozai.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:49.970
I'm sorry.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.790
I'm sorry, Duozai.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.560
Let's go together.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.680
Drink some water.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.280
Drink more.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.000
You taught me to drink water.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.910
[Color Doppler
Ultrasound Examination Report]

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.720
You're pregnant?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
What do you think?

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.290
I'll never have children.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.350
So decisive.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.530
Even with your own flesh and blood.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.930
Drive to the back alley
tonight and wait for me.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.310
Handsome.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.640
Long time no see.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.880
Did you miss me?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.550
Hao.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.030
Hao.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.630
Hao.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:37.480
Are you okay?

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.190
I'm sorry.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.929
Mr. Luo told me he wouldn't force you.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.400
No one can force me.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.840
It was my own choice.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.190
Get Pigpen Boy for me.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.410
Tell him to remove these chains.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.440
There are even two dogs here.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.930
Only these few people?

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.910
This really is a small workshop.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.320
Didn't you ask me to show my sincerity?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.840
I've come to see you in person today.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.580
Isn't that sincere enough?

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.840
The thing I hate most

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.810
is conversations that go nowhere.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.060
Didn't you want to discuss cooperation?

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.510
Come on.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.480
Let's talk.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.510
You agreed so quickly?

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.150
No conditions?

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.740
No conditions.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.430
You're not sincere about cooperating.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.250
I need you

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.630
to be genuinely

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.140
working with me.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.510
Fine.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.230
Then give me back my account.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.680
I'll help you.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.570
That account is very important to you?

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:19.960
Yes.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.600
That certificate is very important to me.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.320
Is this it?

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.050
The account

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.240
and that certificate are both inside.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.110
I never said I wouldn't give them to you.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:43.550
But not now.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.710
I ruined your event before.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.600
That was my fault.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.080
How much product do you want?

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.080
I'll make it all to compensate you.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.640
Why don't you understand?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.480
I don't want the products.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.590
I want you.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.390
Xin Sheng He needs you.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.150
Okay.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.360
I'll cooperate with your Xin Sheng He.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.550
Wouldn't it have been better
if you'd done this earlier?

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.680
Making everything so bloody instead.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.390
What about those two?

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.170
Those two...

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.410
Keeping one cook is enough.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.440
Wait.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.470
My hand is in this condition now.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.210
I need assistants.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.840
We have assistants here.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.970
My product is different from others'.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.710
Even the slightest deviation
makes it impossible to produce.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.040
Those two have been
with me for many years.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.680
No one else can replace them.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.140
Why does it sound like

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.920
you're lying to me?

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.170
To make top-quality product,

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.230
you need precise proportions

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:19.360
and perfect timing.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.510
I've been doing this
in Nanzhou for over 20 years.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.540
Only I know

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.090
which formula works best.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.690
You have your own cook too.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.350
If you don't believe me, you can ask him.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.310
LSD stamps aren't like meth.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.040
Are they really that complicated?

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.980
My LSD stamps contain meth.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.880
That's why you can't make them.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.360
Mou Sen.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.030
You're really smart.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.490
I'm getting
more and more interested in you.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.670
But I have one more condition.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.650
During the entire production process,

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.910
you cannot be present.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.010
If you learn the formula,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.530
you'll definitely kill me.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.560
I just want to stay alive

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.310
and get my account back.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.600
Alright.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.740
We agree to your terms.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.230
Let's begin then.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.110
Fatty,

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.110
you've been with me for so many years.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.320
After a while, don't work for me anymore.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.720
I'll give you some money.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.280
Go home, find a wife and have children.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.160
Live a normal life.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.250
You too, Bro.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.090
Drink less.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.660
Your lips are turning purple.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.550
Why else would you
have earned the nickname "Dead Fatty"?

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:05.550
You talk too much.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.950
It should be here, right?

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.110
It should be.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.240
Why arrange the deal so far away?

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.900
We've already passed Nanzhou.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:35.920
I won't be able to look after you later.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.260
Take care of yourself.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.760
You Dead Fatty.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.360
It's so dark.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.130
Why did they choose this place?

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.320
Hu.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.880
Still breathing?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.190
Not crippled yet.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.670
What happened?

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.190
Didn't I tell you before?

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:23.690
In our line of work,

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.640
we've been risking

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.760
our necks all along.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:32.740
I told you to be careful.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.800
But you wouldn't listen.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.150
You didn't listen but still acted.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.410
You made mistakes and refused to listen.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.320
And worst of all, you never changed.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.680
You had a one-on-one fight?

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.190
And you lost?

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.780
You're really something.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.690
Still got the nerve to eat.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:33.320
Bro,

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.410
get your boss out here
so I can talk to him.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.750
Talk my ass!

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.600
You've got some nerve.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.320
Whether you can walk out of here today

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.640
is still up in the air.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.280
Hu.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.010
Things are getting serious.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.070
Go!

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.670
Go!
