Hello, Uncle.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.870
Duozai,
whom I introduced to you last time,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.310
has he arrived at your place?

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.120
No.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.159
You said he'd come yesterday.

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.220
I waited all day but nobody showed up.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.480
Okay, I see.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.920
Sorry for the trouble, Uncle.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.950
I have to go now.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.950
I'll contact him.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.900
Carry one over and stack it up.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.000
Don't need to take them upstairs?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.630
No need.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.190
Thanks.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.480
Thank you, boss.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.960
Let's go.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.290
Can you cook?

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.950
No.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.170
Let me show you.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.240
No need.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.700
Duozai.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.600
You have to listen to me now.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.200
That's the only way we can get out alive.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.620
What are you doing?

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.560
Your place is small,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.820
but it has everything.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.310
Why don't you tell me

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.920
what makes the birthplace of

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.050
the Ancestral Hall stamps so special?

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.040
Those cheap drugs

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.480
can be made anywhere.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.310
But my stuff

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.159
must be tailored to the specific time,

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:57.760
location,

00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:59.220
and raw materials.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.430
Nanzhou is a coastal city.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.020
It's windy,

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.650
but doesn't get much rain.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.310
So it's drier than other cities.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.790
Your Xinji is more humid.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.630
I see.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.510
The ratio of ingredients in my stuff

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.910
is different every time.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.920
It's to give customers

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.559
a different experience each time.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.580
Of course, adding meth

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.669
increases the cost.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.570
That's why my stamps

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.080
are the most expensive ones on the market.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.720
I never make cheap stuff.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.270
I agree.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.020
Plenty of people
are willing to pay for quality.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.940
So when will my materials arrive?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.910
Stop chatting.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.180
Follow up on Mr. Mou's materials.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.320
Okay.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.360

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.130

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.150
Sure.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.270
He boarded a cuach yesterday,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.930
the morning one to Ningcheng.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.000
He did get on the bus, didn't he?

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.420
The system shows that
he has already boarded the coach.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.240
Could you please
check the surveillance footage for me?

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.900
Certainly.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.630
he didn't show any signs of being unwell.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.270
But after Four-Eyes Hao appeared

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.030
and gave Duozai a cup of unknown liquid,

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.230
Duozai appeared to be in a drowsy state.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.750
And after arriving at the rest stop,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.480
neither of them was seen again.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.790
It doesn't look like he was carsick.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.590
That's right.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.130
It's not carsickness.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.360
If it were carsickness,
he wouldn't be unable to stand.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.720
It's clearly Four-Eyes Hao's plan.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.520
He drugged him and took him away.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.750
Where did he take him?

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.400
He was taken back to Mou Sen.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.060
How do you know?

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.170
Just a guess.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.810
Did you go find Duozai?

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.440
Did you ask him to be an informant?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.120
I didn't.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.440
No way.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.960
You must have forced Duozai
to be an informant.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.240
You've always wanted to do that.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.790
I didn't.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.200
If Yipeng says he didn't, then he didn't.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.960

Don't you want to catch Mou Sen?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.720
Of course, I want,

but not now.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.900
We have a comprehensive plan.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.670
Okay.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.630
I helped you lure Mou Sen out.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.680
Now you do me a favor.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.200
What are you going to do?

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.700
Help me get back to Mou Sen's side.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.920
I know what you intend to do.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.960
But it's too dangerous.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.810
This is my own business.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.600
Mou Sen needs me

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.210
to get an account on the Platinum Road.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.150
He needs me.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.510
I know.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.510
But you're taking too much risk. No.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.000
Fine.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.760
If you won't help me,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.910
I'll find my own way.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.720
Wait, Duozai.

Unless...

Unless what?

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.080
Unless Mou Sen contacts you first.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.080
Will he actually contact me?

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.810
I don't know,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.030
but you can't contact him first.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.690
I told you it's too dangerous.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.290
If he contacts me first,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.460
that's my fate.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.930
Do you accept your fate?

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.080
There are some fates
we must not resign to,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.420
yet others we must accept.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.620
There's another lead.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.870
Someone named Andy from the Platinum Road

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.930
contacted Mou Sen.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.750
Andy is the biggest boss
of the Platinum Road.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.680
The biggest one.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.390
So you allowed Duozai

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.190
to venture back to Mou Sen's side

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.600
just to get information about Andy?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.130
I didn't.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.670
Why did you give him advice?

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.930
What advice did I give?

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080
Can you calm down?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.390
I told him not to go to Mou Sen.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.150
Mou Sen is dangerous.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.680
Besides,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.600
Mou Sen contacted him,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.270
what does that have to do with me?

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.000
You're withholding information,
you know?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.630
Duozai is missing,
and his whereabouts are unknown.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.550
You must
take full responsibility for this.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.790
Why should I take full responsibility?

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.850
Zhi'an, calm down.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.510
Captain Yang...

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.120
He's not Captain Yang anymore.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.720
Fine.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.630
Yipeng

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:56.630
might not know

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.840
that Mou Jiahao would set up Duozai,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.360
Really?

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.120
I did follow Duozai to find Four-Eyes Hao.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.750
But what I thought was

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.790
if I followed Four-Eyes Hao,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.960
I could find out where Mou Sen was.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.480
I never thought he would betray Duozai.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.360
If there was anything about Duozai,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.600
you should have
reported to the team immediately.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.200
If I had known,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.600
I would have stopped him.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.890
Did Duozai come to you?

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.030
Did he?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.720
He didn't tell me
he was going back to Mou Sen.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.320
Then that was his own choice.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.840
But now you...

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.320
But what?

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.150
Every time Duozai is mentioned,

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.720
you act like this.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.360
What do you want to do?

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.870
I'm just discussing the facts with you.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.440

But now,

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.150
the priority is Duozai.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.120

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.150
Once we have control of the situation,

You're two of a kind.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.880
If it weren't for your arrangements,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.340
Duozai would be
working in Ningcheng by now.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.760
Wu Zhi'an.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.680
Let me tell you again.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.160
Duozai has his own ideas about this.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.360
He's already decided

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.680
to return to Mou Sen.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.000
Yes.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.800
I admit I said something to him,

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.000
which might have reminded him.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.960
So when Andy contacted him,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.290
he started his own plan.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.910
Using the Platinum Road account

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.240
to lure Mou Sen into bringing him back.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.830
So him being taken by Four-Eyes Hao

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.480
might be part of his plan.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.070
You know so much about it.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.110
You planned this all along, didn't you?

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.440
I didn't arrange any of this.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.500
I'm telling you again, I didn't do it!

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.240
Besides, he's not doing this for me.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.310
Is it for me then?

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.810
He's doing it for himself.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.260
What was your childhood aspiration?

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.670
To become Ultraman Taro?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.100
When I was little, I used to wonder

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.070
how I could join them.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.410
How would you join?

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:32.150
Well,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.210
you need to find an opportunity

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.790
to sacrifice yourself

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.880
and save others.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.680
Once they see your sacrifice,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.140
they will be deeply moved.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.000
Then they would invite me

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.030
to join them.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.030

You don't need to worry so much.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.200
If Mou Sen brought him back,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.440
he won't kill Duozai.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.280
There's just one issue though.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.880
Whether he can
make Mou Sen trust him again

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.740
depends on him.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.880
But honestly,

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.310
do you want him to go back to Mou Sen?

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.370

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.480
That only Nanzhou
can produce top-quality product?

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.510
He's just trying to prove his worth

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.800
to save his own skin.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.360
But I really do like it here.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.590
Around Nanzhou,

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.360
there are several uninhabited islands

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.160
where we could build factories.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.110
But I think the cook is dangerous.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.710
He won't willingly be manipulated.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.690
He and I are alike at heart—

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.540
we only care about ourselves.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.140
What should we do then?

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.440
I like him.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.610
You really like him?

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.960
You're jealous.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.770
I like that obsessive look he gets
when he's cooking.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.150
But you're different.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.480
Once I figure out

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.000
how the Ancestral Hall stamps

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.320
are made,

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.960
I won't need him anymore.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.570
I'll take care of him then.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.630
Can you go down and check

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.160
if there's anything to eat.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.820
What would you like to eat?

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.100
So, what are we eating?

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:20.600
I'll go buy some.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.510
Move it!

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.890
Remember what I taught you?

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.440
Yes.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.520
The reagent dosage
must be extremely precise.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.730
Even the slightest deviation

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.680
will lead to failure.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.000
Take this for drying.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.270
After drying, this material

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.890
can spontaneously combust

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.280
and explode.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.330
Let me do it.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.490
Give it to me.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.150
We just

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.590
have to wait.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.710
Of course I do.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.320

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.650
that we need to carry on.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.190
I let anyone who wants to write one.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.840
Oh, come on.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.760
You even make everyone write wills.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.090
You're just throwing your weight around.

Don't talk nonsense.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.260
How am I abusing power?

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.770
I only asked the ones who were willing to.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.320
Besides, we all have to
face it eventually.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:21.960
We all gotta go sometime.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.590
What's there to be afraid of?

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:23.070
Right?

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.110

on the day I retire,

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.840
I'll show these to my son

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.670
how brave and capable his dad was.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.730
Don't you think so?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.190
Would you stop going on about retiring?

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.520
You've still got several good years left.

you're going?

We're on the final step.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.610
All we have to do is wait.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.630
We're going out for some fresh air.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.160

Yes.

Once the solution cools down,

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.810
