00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.460
How about you
make an appointment for tomorrow?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.380
There's still time tomorrow.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.180
Yi Aida?

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.180
She studied in the Soviet Union,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.660
has work experience at SMR,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.020
and knows code-breaking.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.180
Her age also matches.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.020
The most important thing is

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.490
she risked hiding the fact that
she has a stomach illness.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.980
Combining all these signs,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.020
I suspect she could be Bai Ye.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.700
When will the token that can make Bai Ye

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.700

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.980
I'm afraid there's not enough time.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.260
Wait another two days.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.020
In the meantime,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.300
we'll first deploy an evacuation plan.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.980
Once the token arrives,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.300
I'll inform you immediately.

Here's the situation.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.460
Dong Jinbo and Liu Fangbai
from your team

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.180
are good at their jobs,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.580

Alright.

to get chosen.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.020

Thank you for supporting my work.

The news
that the Xige Code may be broken

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.020
has alarmed Director Dai.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.940
Chongqing's order has been relayed
to the Third War Zone.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.260
Starting today,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.500
all army groups
will stop using the Xige Code,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.140
and implement radio silence
for three days.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.260
Within three days,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.140
Shen Wanqing must be executed.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.700
Are you sure
Shen Wanqing isn't one of ours?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.500
And he's deliberately dragging

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.940
the progress of breaking the Xige Code.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.260
Do we have to act now?

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.580
Changchun Bureau has confirmed
he's not one of ours.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.500
That's enough.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.020
We'd rather kill
by mistake than let him go.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.020
If he hands over the decryption plan

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.900
or accidentally leaks it,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.820
the consequences would be unimaginable.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.700
Even if he is an anti-Japanese patriot?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.580
What the higher-ups mean is

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.730
we just need to carry out
the Sword Thrust Operation well.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.580
What I want is to resist Japan,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.940
not to follow the higher-ups' whims.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.730
Are they really afraid of
the Xige Code leaking

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.820
or are they afraid
Shen Wanqing is a Communist?

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.500
We don't need to speculate on that.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.820
You only need to know

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.940
we are to eliminate every possibility

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.170
of the Xige Code leaking.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.820
The day after tomorrow,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.170
I must send news of Shen Wanqing's death

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.290
back to Chongqing.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.140
Secretary Mao asked me to tell you

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.060
that Commander Gu will be staying
at his place these days.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.730
Once you complete the mission,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.500
they'll celebrate for you together.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.140
I want just one word from you now.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.580
Are you in or not?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.380
If you won't do it,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.900
I will.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.820
Ms. Xian, you're back.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.580
Ms. Xian.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.500
Your favorite white sugar cake.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.140
Thank you, Ms. Xian.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.060
You really know me well.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.140
Back when you first joined the troupe,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.900
Wu would often tell me

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.580
it seemed a mouse was in the kitchen,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.820
stealing white sugar cakes.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.580
That was you, right?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.620
No.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.580
There really was a mouse.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.580
I was just afraid such good things

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.020
would be gnawed away by mice.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.900
What a pity that would be.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.140
What's the occasion today?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.140
Why are you making all this?

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.140
Ms. Xian, leave it for now.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.530
Come on.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:37.900
Please, sit.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.770
Wait a moment.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.260
Gu Yangshan.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.380
Dinner's ready.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.620
Gu Yangshan.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.410
Charlie!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.020
What's wrong?

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.740
Dinner's served, Young Master Gu.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.140
What's with you today?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.860
You've been absent-minded
since you got back.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.900
Come here.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.020
Sit.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.380
The dishes are getting cold.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.500
Let me tell you,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.740
I cooked today's dishes myself.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.900
Each of these is my signature dish.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.140
You must eat more.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.020
I've known you for so long,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.900
but I never knew you could cook.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.740
What's the occasion today?

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.380
It's my birthday.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.900
Ever since I was little,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.740
I've always celebrated my birthday

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.380
with my mom.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.500
Even though
we couldn't afford any good food,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.620
as long as my mom was home,
it felt like home.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.100
Having family celebrate my birthday

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.740
made me feel that year wasn't wasted.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.860
Though my mom isn't here with me today,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.740
I have you two here.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.740
So I thought

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.740
I'd have you accompany me
for my birthday,

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.860
so it would feel complete.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.020
You know what,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:50.900
in my hometown,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.980
you must eat six eggs on birthdays.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.860
Do you know what that means?

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.740
It means smooth sailing and reunion

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.900
in the year to come.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.020
So,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.020
today I'll peel one egg for each of you.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.980
You must both eat it.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.100
My mom always said

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.020
everything should be around
the birthday person.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.100
Today I'm the birthday person,
so you should be around me.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.900
Whatever I say, goes.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.900
Let's drink happily

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.380
and eat joyfully.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.140
Otherwise,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.380
the rest of my year
will surely be unlucky.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.220
It's your birthday.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.220
Shouldn't you be the one
to eat all six eggs?

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.260
Wait.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.380
It brings you safety, happy birthday.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.260
Such superstitions.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:07.980
Here.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.380
The birthday person
should make the first toast.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.900
Along the way,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.740
it's thanks to you two

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.260
that I've been able to
live safely till now.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.380
So I toast to you both.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.740
Thank you.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.900
Toast to Ms. Xian as well.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.220
She's helped you plenty too.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.220
How could you be like this?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.500
Ms. Xian.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.860
Thank you.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.220
I'll join in.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.140
Thank you.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.500
I toast to you both.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.140
Cheers.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.900
Don't just drink,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.140
eat some food.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.140
Try it, see if it's good.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.020
Well?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.100
Is it good?

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.140
Too salty?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.020
Too sour?

KMT general Han Deqin's unit
issued a mopping-up order,

determined to use all their elite
of nearly 40k troops

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.300

in northern Jiangsu in one swoop.

A small ripple in Chongqing

No matter
what Gu Yangshan's next move is,

will no longer be peaceful.

the token to contact Comrade Bai Ye.

Right now we can only
fight speed with speed

then evacuate together.

Do we have to leave?

Gu Yangshan won't betray us.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.690
I understand your concern.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.780
If you leave,

Gu Yangshan's mission

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.900
will inevitably not be able to continue.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.060
But have you thought

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.860
that if he knew your true stance,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.450
what choice would he make?

isn't worth mentioning.

you could come with me to take a look.

I never thought these books

were anything special.

You could say we share common interests.

Fate really plays tricks on people.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.970
I also privately asked around,

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.970
but found nothing.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.380
However, I believe

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.620
that one or two
would still be in Shanghai.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.210
Ms. Xian,

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.690
you have connections in Shanghai.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.780
Can you help me ask around?

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.820
Miss Yi.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.450
Among your friends,

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.300
is there a young boy
with the surname Su?

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.300
Yes.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.380
You know him?

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.100
Where is he now?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.380
I don't know.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.450
But I can ask a friend
to help you look into it.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.780
That'd be great.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.580
Ms. Xian, you might not know.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:58.900
After I returned to Shanghai,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.340
I lost touch with them.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.170
I felt like a kite with its string cut.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.380
Now I can finally find my way home.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:13.900
Miss Yi.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.140
I told you
I really feel a connection with you.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.340
Don't worry.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.210
I'll definitely help you
find your lost friends.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.860
I'll definitely help you
find your lost friends.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.340
Using coffee in place of wine,

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.540
I promise you.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.380
Miss Yi.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.690
Be patient and wait for my news.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.140
Alright.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.450
I have other matters to attend to,

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.210
so I'll be leaving.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.410
Darling.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.210
Why are you here?

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.690
Biyun.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.060
Aren't we meeting someone?

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:48.300
Let's go.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.970
Something's wrong.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.410
Don't talk.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.380
Yi Aida is not Bai Ye.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.450
She is Liang Jingyuan's bait.

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.410
I'm afraid that since the day
at the stock exchange,

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:51.490
Liang Jingyuan had already planned to
lure us in.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.820
Director Liang.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.490
How can you be sure

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.970
that Joseph Lee is colluding
with the Communists?

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.300
Everyone has a certain innate,
unique ability.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.660
Mine is intuition.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.820
Intuition tells me

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.970
there's definitely something wrong
with them.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:19.570
Of course,

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.050
I can also see Miss Yi's abilities.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.050
As long as you finish this task,

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.530
and your father cracks the Xige Code,

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.450
then he will become the director

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.410
of this institute.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.450
What you really mean is

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.050
if Joseph Lee and Xian Biyun are gone,

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:41.450
you can use the chance
to rise to the Special Agent Headquarters.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.090
Miss Yi is a smart person.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.300
I like dealing with smart people.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.490
Do I look convincing?

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.610
You can go now.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.090
Miss Yi.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.410
Is your face alright?

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.900
Ms. Xian, what do you need from me?

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.610
Director Liang, was that satisfactory?

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.970
Xian Biyun has taken the bait.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.970
Was the coffee good?

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.010
Wait, how did you know?

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.900
If Yi Aida

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.970
had been working in codebreaking
for a long time,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.260
the area near the tip of
her right middle finger

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.970
would have calluses
from long-term pen holding.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.380
I carefully felt her hand.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.780
There were only calluses
at the base of the thumb.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:09.490
That's from prolonged gun handling.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.530
I think you're overthinking.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.530
That's quite normal.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.860
Take Gu Yangshan for example,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.300
he can break codes and shoot.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.970
Aren't you all skilled in
both pen and sword?

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:23.900
Also,

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.860
today I deliberately changed
the contact info

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.860
from a little girl to
a little boy named Susu.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.530
She didn't notice anything odd.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.660
Most importantly,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.010
Bai Ye has had a stomach illness
for many years.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.010
She should know she can't drink coffee.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.130
Just now I made her a cup

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.380
with triple the coffee powder.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.530
Not only did she not refuse,

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:47.860
she showed no discomfort after drinking.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.300
So she is definitely not Bai Ye.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.900
At such a critical time,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.970
not a single detail can be overlooked.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.860
Tell me,

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.860
can a person with stomach illness
drink coffee?

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.010
Using coffee in place of wine,

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.490
I promise you.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.970
Go find out if you've been exposed.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.180
If you can't catch the fish,

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:27.450
then the bait is useless.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:35.780
Do you like Beethoven?

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.660
His overtures are so powerful.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.860
They make one's blood boil.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.970
But after the overture,

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.700
everything feels so dull.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.610
It's awful!

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.900
Susu.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.660
What's wrong with you?

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:31.530
Who is Susu?

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.180
She is Bai Ye's daughter.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.660
She's being raised in Yan'an now.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.380
If Charlie could also help me

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.380
retrieve the car,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.490
that would be great.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.010
That reminds me.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.340
On the day of the check-up,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.380
didn't Shen Wanqing shamelessly

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.490
ask us to ride in our car?

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.450
Later I refused.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.860
And then he told me...

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.610
My car is parked at No. 37 Luban Road.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.700
The key is with Miss Huang Susu.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.530
Huang Susu?

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.340
Are you sure you didn't mishear?

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.180
You know my memory.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.900
Do you think the Huang Susu
he talked about

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.090
could be related to the Susu

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.410
you mentioned?

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:14.820
Let's go check.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.340
Don't act blind later.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.380
Joseph Lee's features are too distinct.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.090
Don't leave too many traces.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.900
Don't worry, Ms. Xian.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:40.900
Who is it?

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.530
It's Mr. Shen.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.860
Mr. Shen told me to come here.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.860
Why so early?

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.090
Can't it be later?

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:57.260
It's urgent, can we talk inside?

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.130
Shen who?

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.130
Shen Wanqing.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:07.820
And who are you?

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.610
Put on some clothes first.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.820
She's taking forever to get changed.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.610
What kind of clothes are those?

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.180
Why did Shen Wanqing
come to you the other day?

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.900
What else would a man want from me?

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:51.380
Smoke some opium, drink some liquor,

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.700
and do that thing.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.090
He also smokes opium?

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.010
What's strange about that?

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.900
Every time he came to see me,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.130
he had me buy
two opium cakes downstairs,

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.090
and a bottle of liquor.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.490
Every time he came,

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.010
he'd drink and smoke?

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.380
Every time?

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.530
He likes to watch me dance,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.180
then watch me smoke.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.490
After I smoke too much, I fall asleep.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.010
When I wake up, he's gone.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.260
I don't know.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.450
Every time I wake up,
the opium and liquor are gone.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:53.380
One last question.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.380
Is your name Huang Susu?

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.860
What are you talking about?

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.820
Absurd.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.450
My name is Huang Yingying.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:10.490
If mixed with liquor,

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.260
opium paste can become
tincture of opium.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.860
It's a powerful painkiller.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:18.260
But at the check-up, I was there.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.490
He didn't have stomach trouble at all.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.130
I don't know what method he used

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.090
to fool the doctor.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:24.900
But he is very likely Bai Ye.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.490
He knew the day we

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.820
went to the stock exchange,

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.180
and deliberately came to test us.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.860
He changed Huang Yingying to Huang Susu

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.410
to give us a hint.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.860
Unfortunately at that time,

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.860
I had not yet received

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.380
the contact token from the Organization,

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.180
and didn't understand the subtext.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.090
We should go back to
the institute immediately

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.090
and look for Shen Wanqing.

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.340
Go.
