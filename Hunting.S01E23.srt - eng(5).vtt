You went back to Mou Sen.

Why didn't you tell me that?

If I back out now, he'll get suspicious.

Hello, Duozai.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.440
there are some abandoned mining sites

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.600
remotely located in complicated areas

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.130
with few inhabitants.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.260
Could it be possible

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.150
that the Platinum Road we're looking for

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.800
is actually hidden in there?

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.890
That would explain

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.580
why a car suddenly disappeared
when it got here.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.960
The Platinum Road

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.450
should be somewhere around here.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.260
Let's check out the foot of the mountain.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.880
Our current supplies

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.140
are sufficient for long-term survival.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.780
Even if we end up
getting cut off from the outside world,

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.220
we don't need to worry about safety here.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.230
Unbelievable.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.670
I thought

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.890
the Platinum Road was just a network.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.020
I didn't expect it to be here.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.650
We will continue to grow.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.450
As long as we have a platform,
raw materials, capital,

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.400
and sales, of course,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.280
we'll build some new facilities

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.070
to produce our own drugs.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.920
I want the Platinum Road
to develop its own brand!

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.920
For that,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.940
I need you to join us.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.600
Together,

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.280
we can become leaders
in global market of drugs.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.710
Coming here

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.600
is the best decision I ever made.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.230
The returns on your involvement
in the Platinum Road

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.630
will not disappoint you.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.190
Everyone here is a shareholder.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.230
And this...

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.110
This is our common kingdom.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.590
We've detected some

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.100
weak signal interference sources nearby.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.700
Very good.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.800
Keep monitoring.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.480
It seems

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.230
their equipment

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.960
is affecting our monitoring.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.000
This is the location.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.800
If what Boji said is true,

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.190
and we can truly find
signal interference sources here,

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:57.070
then there must be

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.360
operation facilities
regarding the dark web.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.310
Duozai has really led us
to the Platinum Road.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.840
