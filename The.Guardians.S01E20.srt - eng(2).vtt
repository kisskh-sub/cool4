[General Affairs Office]

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.290
Right now only my department
is short-staffed.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.290
If you still want this job,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.260
do your work properly.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.180
Stop thinking about going back
to the Decryption Section.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.020
Otherwise, just quit.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.100
I won't stop you.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.380
Mr. Lee.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.660
Do you need something from me?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.740
Ms. Ye.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.380
Charlie went to get my medicine,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.890
so I had to personally
bring you these receipts.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.060
You could've just called me

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.260
and I'd have come up for you.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.380
You don't have to come in person.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.500
Director Lee, just give them to me.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.100
Alright, thank you.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.100
I'm heading to Renji Hospital now.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.100
Tomorrow we're doing
a physical check-up.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.820
Liang gave me very short notice.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.940
I must hurry.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.220
Take care.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.820
Since you can't do it well,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.500
why force yourself?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.570
With Mr. Yi's salary,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.100
it should be enough
to support one daughter.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.820
Work shouldn't be only for a salary.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.980
Man is a working animal.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.780
What distinguishes humans from animals

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.380
should be labor.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.940
If you put it that way,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.380
then all those young ladies
and wives who stay home

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.980
aren't human?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.820
Wives staying home

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.660
are their husband's private property.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.820
And women who marry for a living

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.060
are essentially selling
themselves into marriage.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.660
That's not the life I want.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.130
Miss Yi.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.100
I personally appreciate
independent modern women.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.260
But a person

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.220
shouldn't mistreat their own health.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.660
You vomited so badly just now.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.260
Is your stomach unwell?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.850
Charlie's back.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.980
I'll take my leave.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.850
Open the door.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.050
Wait a moment.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.610
Open up.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.170
Thank you.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.290
Mr. Shen.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.170
Charlie.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.980
It's already afternoon.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.850
I overslept.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.610
Don't tell Director Liang.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.730
Charlie.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.290
Mr. Lee.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.850
What are you doing here?

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.170
I came down to submit
receipts for reimbursement.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.410
You can just leave such things to me.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.050
You don't need to come yourself.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.290
Thank you, Miss Yi.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.170
You're welcome.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.090
Much appreciated, Miss Yi.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.850
That Amu

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.970
is like a ghost,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.140
appearing from nowhere.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.890
He walks without making a sound.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.650
I was scared.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.890
I'm telling you, Ding Yi.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.410
No matter what,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.020
I won't let you act alone.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.890
Understand?

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.090
You're not yet capable
of acting independently.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.650
You're not mature enough.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.530
What are you talking about?

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.890
Look at you.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.210
Getting sensitive again, aren't you?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.880
[Principles of Cryptography]

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.140
Ms. Xian asks me to perform a task,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.970
and I'm immature?

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.740
When you asked me to help you before,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.890
you thought
I could handle things on my own.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.140
Mr. Shen.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.210
Charlie.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.580
I have read your work before.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.290
It was very enlightening.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.890
I have a small request.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.970
Could I trouble you for an autograph?

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.020
There's no problem with that.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.970
But I don't deserve your admiration.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.740
Mr. Lee is the real master here.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.140
What I know is just superficial.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.140
Superficial.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.180
That's a nice pen you have.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.180
Where did you buy it?

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.890
Master.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.210
I've been looking for you everywhere.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.770
The meeting has been waiting for you
to start.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.140
Sorry, Charlie.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.740
I'll sign it later, okay?

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.170
How is it?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.740
Chongqing's

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.530
investigation results
on Yi Xiuyuan have arrived.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.170
Your suspicions were correct.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.980
The Japanese helped
Liang Jingyuan rise to power,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.980
and in exchange,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.170
Liang Jingyuan would persuade

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.380
Yi Xiuyuan and other cryptography
experts to defect to Japan.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.740
Among these experts,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.220
many have received training
from American experts.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.380
More or less, they all know some secrets

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.220
about the U.S. military to help our army

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.460
establish the Xige Code system.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.930
Chongqing also suspects

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.570
that the materials Yi Xiuyuan took away

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.100
likely included

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.460
discarded drafts from
the design of the Xige Code.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.930
If that's true,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.220
their decryption time
would be greatly reduced.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.170
Since its launch,

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.980
the Xige Code has consistently won.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.170
It's our strongest fortress

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.570
in the code war,

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.220
so it must not be cracked
by the Japanese.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.460
Chongqing

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.620
is eager to know

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.770
their decryption progress,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.810
preferably in real-time.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.980
But Liang Jingyuan
doesn't trust Joseph Lee.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.740
Ding Yi can't get involved.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.860
I can only wait until

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.100
tomorrow, and think of a plan

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.980
when Liang Jingyuan organizes everyone

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.220
for physical check-ups.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.050
Help me investigate someone.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.930
Who?

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.220
Forget it.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.380
Is the food bad?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.100
Too much vinegar?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.930
Is it sour?

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.170
Just right.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.980
Just right.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.860
I'm done eating.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.570
Ms. Xian,

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.260
Yi Aida does have a stomach disease.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:44.860
Well,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.620
I heard her vomiting in the institute.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.980
And she actually knows code-breaking.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.740
How do you know she knows code-breaking?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.980
I overheard it.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.980
In the office,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.740
Ye Yin gave Yi Aida a scolding.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.980
And then she said,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.260
she's actually best at code-breaking.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.690
So she wants to work with
Yi Xiuyuan like before.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.980
So I think

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.220
Yi Aida

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.220
is very likely
the one we're looking for.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.460
Think about it,
she's been to the Stock Exchange,

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.810
has a stomach disease,
and knows code-breaking.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.930
Did you say anything you shouldn't have?

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.100
Of course not, I'm not stupid.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.860
Oh right,
there's another very important thing.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.980
That jerk Liang Jingyuan

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.620
is organizing everyone

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.620
to go to Renji Hospital
for checkups tomorrow.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.100
So I think,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.100
he may have also gotten some intel.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.530
He's trying to find out
who has stomach trouble.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.260
I'm going out.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.460
Alright.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.570
Ms. Xian.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.290
I...

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.020
You two talk.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.570
I...

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.690
I'll just sit here for a bit of tea.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.530
You go upstairs first.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.170
I have something
to talk over with Ms. Xian.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.530
Then I'll go upstairs for tea.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.690
Get in.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.690
Ms. Xian.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.050
I need the keys for Yi Xiuyuan

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.930
and Shen Wanqing's offices.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.170
What does that have to do with me?

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.810
Ye Yin is the head of
General Affairs Office.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.530
I know she has keys
to the entire institute.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.930
What do you plan to do?

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.650
Ms. Xian,

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.650
I'm not asking what you want to do

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.770
when you have Ding Yi
keep a close watch on Yi Aida.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.260
When do you need them?

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.890
The sooner the better.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.170
I must have the keys
before tomorrow's physical check-ups.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.330
as you both know,

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.850
we weren't at the institute
the day before yesterday,

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.330
but that communist

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.770
just happened to act that day.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.740
We were caught off guard.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.850
I was hurriedly called back.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.500
My car is still there.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.980
I originally wanted to
go get it back today,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.610
but then a physical check-up
was suddenly arranged.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.050
You see,

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.020
how can I go for
the check-up without a car?

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.570
I don't quite understand what you mean.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.810
Do you want a ride in my car

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.740
to the hospital for the check-up?

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.090
But sorry,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.290
I...

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.370
Director Lee is truly brilliant.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.890
Me, and my two apprentices,

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.060
Li Huan and Li Yu.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.570
Mr. Shen, why don't you

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.610
ask your two beloved apprentices

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.300
to help you retrieve the car?

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.650
They're just my apprentices.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:59.780
There are some things a master

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.130
cannot let his apprentices know.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.540
I promised Director Liang

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.610
I would never go to that place again.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.330
It's only been two days, and if I go,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.300
wouldn't that be bad?

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.300
If Charlie could incidentally help me

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.060
retrieve the car,

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.090
that would be wonderful.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.130
My car is parked at No. 37 Lvban Road.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.130
The keys are with Miss Huang Susu.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.850
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:30.570
As you can see,

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.020
my wife is driving today.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.330
I cannot allow my wife

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.850
to be a driver for other men.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.090
Director Lee.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.810
My apologies, Mr. Shen.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.890
It's fine that they don't want us
hitch a ride,

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.370
but why did they get angry?

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.570
I didn't expect Liang Jingyuan
to have a backup plan.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.780
Now, it's definitely too late

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.890
to stop the check-ups.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.300
When we get to the hospital later,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.890
I'll watch Yi Aida.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.020
You watch Dong Jinbo, Liu Fangbai,

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.090
and Shen Wanqing.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.300
Alright.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.240

[Xige Code]

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:02.090
Mrs. Lee.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.650
Everyone's here.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:03.020
Mrs. Lee.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.610
Mrs. Lee.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.540
You can sit here.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.260
It's fine, there are seats inside.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.130
Hello, Mrs. Lee.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:16.740
Miss Yi.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:19.890
Ms. Xian.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.130
Come sit down.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.740
Are you feeling better?

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.500
After taking the medicine you sent,

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.500
I'm really much better.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.700
Good that it worked.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:32.740
Only women understand best

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.060
how bad this pain feels.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.090
I'll give you
the prescription another day.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.500
Next time your period comes,

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.740
you'll be prepared in advance.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.810
Ms. Xian, you are really kind.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.650
Now I know

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.330
why Director Lee
cares about you so much.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.130
Does he?

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.890
I once read a book,

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.610
advocating for women's liberation.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.410
The book said

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.740
the only reason for
men and women to unite

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.300
should be mutual admiration.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.540
That is true monogamy.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.460
I seem to see
what marriage should be like

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.820
from you and Director Lee.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.940
What's the name of the book?
I'd like to read it too.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.170
Sorry, I can't recall it at the moment.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:29.770
Next.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.570
I'll go in first.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.250
Inhale.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.460
Exhale.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.650
Inhale.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.650
Exhale.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.540
Now, let's check your stomach.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.650
Do you feel any discomfort
when I press here?

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.820
Relax.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.210
Miss Yi.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.690
Your stomach might have a problem.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.940
I recommend further examination.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.420
Hello, Director.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.250
Director.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.860
I've got a family to support.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.210
Director.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.060
How is it?

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.650
How is it?

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.380
Nothing serious.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.460
Just a minor stomach problem.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.860
It's common in our line of work.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.460
You're right.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.340
When it gets busy, you forget to eat.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.130
Nobody's stomach can take it.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.380
Isn't this perfect?

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.650
While the institute
is paying for check-ups,

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:49.860
we can get a thorough check.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.020
To be honest with you two,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.460
I thought that
I'd definitely see Japanese doctors

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.460
at a Japanese hospital.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.130
For easier communication,

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.820
I even learned a few Japanese phrases.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.420
Thank you.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.170
But it's still a Chinese doctor.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.730
Look at you.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.820
Dong Jinbo.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.290
Goodbye.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:06.900
Director Lee.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.060
You're here.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.730
There's no waiting area outside.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.170
How about I take you inside first?

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.650
Thank you.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.540
This way.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.380
Doctor.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.420
This is our director.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.210
His eyes are not good,

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.980
and there's no place to rest outside.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.650
How about letting him get checked first?

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.170
Okay.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.860
No need, rules are rules.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:30.170
I don't mind waiting.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.820
Please sit and rest for a while.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.420
Thank you.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.170
Careful.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.380
Director Lee, then I'll go before you.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.090
This way.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.250
Take off your coat.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.820
Okay.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.340
Miss Yi.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.340
You should pay attention to your diet.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.980
Don't eat raw, cold, spicy food anymore.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.820
Okay.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:56.650
It's alright, I'll pick it up.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.460
Sorry.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.130
Thank you, doctor.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.860
Alright, pay attention to rest and diet.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.380
Okay.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.540
Next.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.940
Ms. Xian.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.210
I'm going to the next check-up.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.060
Doctor.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.380
Anything wrong with my stomach?

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.020
Just a minor stomach ulcer.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.380
But you must be careful.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.460
If you continue to eat irregularly,

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.460
it's very likely to get worse

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.730
and develop into stomach cancer.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.090
That serious?

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.460
Could you prescribe
some medicine for my stomach?

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.170
Sorry.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.650
We are only responsible
for physical examinations here.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.020
Thank you.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.340
Next.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.820
I'm heading back then.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.130
Mr. Shen, you go first.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.250
Take care of yourself.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.690
Mr. Shen.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.690
Director Lee.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.340
I thought it was my turn.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:19.570
Shen Wanqing, right?

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.820
It is your turn.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.380
Come, this way.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.210
Please.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.460
Bend your legs.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.250
Tell me if you feel any discomfort.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.900
Okay.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.210
Deep breath.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:48.170
Exhale.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.420
Does it hurt here?

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.250
No.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.090
Here?

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.210
No.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.500
And here?

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.610
No.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.060
How does it feel here?

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.340
No pain, it's fine.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.650
And here?

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.290
No.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:13.770
Does it hurt here?

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.020
Director Lee.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.130
It's really not easy for you

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.860
code researchers.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.500
See?

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.860
He just fell asleep.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.340
Must have worked hard.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.730
Done.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.380
Did I fall asleep?

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.130
Sorry.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.250
Is there anything wrong with me?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.540
Everything's fine.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:45.690
Go to the next check-up.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.900
Okay.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:48.340
Thank you.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.500
Director Lee, I'll head out first.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.380
Master.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.420
Mr. Shen, are you alright?

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.340
I'm fine.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.060
That's good.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.860
You all keep queuing.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.980
Goodbye, Mr. Shen.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.460
Charlie.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.650
So you're saying

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.980
it's most likely that Bai Ye is Yi Aida?

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.420
No, that's not right.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.730
Dong Jinbo and Liu Fangbai
could also be Bai Ye.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.420
Comrade Bai Ye has always been
very cautious.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.820
When he was undercover
in the Northeast before,

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.860
he always relied on his handler, Hei,

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.460
to help him procure stomach medicine.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.820
So he absolutely didn't want

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.210
anyone else to know
he had a stomach disease.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.860
According to your description just now,

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:07.820
these two people

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.340
had no intention of hiding
their stomach diseases at all.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:15.730
In contrast, Yi Aida

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.170
secretly swapped her examination report.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.380
She also didn't want anyone
to know she had a stomach disease.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:26.250
Yes.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.020
Last time at the Stock Exchange,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.540
when Bai Ye discovered the ambush,

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.980
he must have realized

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.860
he had attracted
Liang Jingyuan's attention.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.170
And this time,
Liang Jingyuan inexplicably

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.290
organized everyone
for a physical check-up.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.540
Bai Ye probably guessed

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.130
Liang Jingyuan also got wind
of his stomach disease.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.380
So he would definitely
hide his condition.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.420
Right?

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.400
Right.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.900
Are there any problems
with Shen Wanqing's calculation drafts?

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.460
His calculation drafts
are filled with solution approaches.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.060
But every single one is wrong.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.540
Some are wrong in the formulas,

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.020
some are wrong in the substitutions.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:15.900
Isn't that a good thing?

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.130
To crack a code

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.650
is like walking in the dark.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.380
But there are traps everywhere.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.060
With Yi Xiuyuan's ability,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.380
he only wrote two or three methods
in his drafts

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.770
and he's still stuck in the traps.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:29.420
But as for Shen Wanqing,

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.130
in his calculation drafts,

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.650
there are at least
20 solution approaches.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.170
But just as each approach
reaches success,

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.460
it's cleverly steered away by him.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.420
It's as if he already knows
the correct answer,

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.170
but is deliberately taking detours

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.500
to avoid the correct answer.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.420
Are you saying Shen Wanqing's already...

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.290
That's right.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.860
I suspect Shen Wanqing

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.340
has already cracked the Xige Code

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.650
but he hasn't reported it yet.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.210
Not only hasn't he reported it,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:56.540
he submits a different

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.060
incorrect answer every day

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.340
to conceal the fact that
he has already cracked it.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.020
Good, I'll send these photos

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.860
back to Chongqing soon.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.020
Okay.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.380
These crumpled ones are Shen Wanqing's.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:12.860
Okay.
