00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:51.018
That's really amazing.

00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:51.377
Really?

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.058
I didn't guess.

00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:53.337
At the very last second,

00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:54.578
band-aid.

00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:56.138
How did you figure it out?

00:01:56.218 --> 00:01:57.377
Is there a story behind this?

00:01:57.737 --> 00:01:59.058
My husband knows me quite well.

00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:00.138
The band-aid

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:01.058
was stuck right here.

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:03.633
- Awesome.
- Absolutely.

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:04.457
Sir.

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:07.897
I saw Shen Haoming

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:11.098
and his wife at Yanbo Resort.

00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:13.818
They are with the Baraikins.

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:16.337
Looks like we've got competition.

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:17.617
You look into it.

00:02:18.018 --> 00:02:19.937
Stop Shen Haoming at all costs

00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:21.937
from gaining the Baraikins' favor.

00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:23.538
You two are amazing!

00:02:24.737 --> 00:02:26.177
How does that Chinese saying go?

00:02:26.497 --> 00:02:28.177
A couple

00:02:28.177 --> 00:02:29.538
has a connection.

00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:30.818
To be precise,

00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:34.098
a lovely couple has one heart.

00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:36.217
How many times must I remind you?

00:02:37.378 --> 00:02:38.337
Tomorrow at the hotel,

00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:40.018
there's a folk culture fair.

00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:41.858
I'd like to invite you both.

00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:42.418
Thanks.

00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:43.337
- Okay?
- Sounds good.

00:02:43.337 --> 00:02:44.737
We'll be there on time.

00:02:45.418 --> 00:02:45.777
Great.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:47.098
See you tomorrow.

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:50.217
Seeing the two of you

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.818
reminds me of my husband and me

00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:53.617
when we were just married.

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:55.418
Back when you just married?

00:02:56.937 --> 00:02:58.098
We were just

00:02:58.138 --> 00:02:59.497
in our twenties.

00:02:59.858 --> 00:03:02.057
I was alone in Russia,

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.298
working odd jobs

00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:04.378
while studying.

00:03:04.698 --> 00:03:06.098
No family, no friends.

00:03:07.657 --> 00:03:08.457
Then one day,

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:08.937
he walked

00:03:09.737 --> 00:03:11.497
into the convenience store
where I worked.

00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:12.737
While checking out,

00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:13.578
he said,

00:03:15.098 --> 00:03:17.217
"You're beauty."

00:03:17.858 --> 00:03:18.897
You're beauty?

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:20.777
You're beautiful.

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:23.617
Yes, he said that.

00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:26.337
That's when I knew

00:03:27.057 --> 00:03:28.298
he was different.

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:30.018
Don't laugh.

00:03:30.578 --> 00:03:31.777
I practiced that many times!

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.000
Your Chinese is better now.

00:03:36.298 --> 00:03:37.777
To your beautiful love story,

00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:39.018
let's toast!

00:03:39.057 --> 00:03:39.457
Cheers!

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:40.098
Thank you.

00:04:19.977 --> 00:04:20.498
Thank you.

00:04:24.258 --> 00:04:25.178
I'm wondering

00:04:26.258 --> 00:04:28.378
why you're not approaching Mr. Baraikin

00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:29.818
through Jinda Group

00:04:30.018 --> 00:04:30.857
formally?

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.417
Why go to all this

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:33.537
to get close to him?

00:04:35.457 --> 00:04:36.977
Is the company in trouble?

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:42.258
The truth is,

00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:43.897
my dad doesn't trust me at the company.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.537
Those old men on the board

00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:49.378
all pretend

00:04:49.618 --> 00:04:51.178
to humor me.

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:52.297
Moreover,

00:04:52.738 --> 00:04:54.138
Jinda Group's

00:04:54.138 --> 00:04:55.217
overseas managers

00:04:56.738 --> 00:04:57.738
were incompetent,

00:04:57.857 --> 00:04:59.058
so international expansion

00:04:59.097 --> 00:05:00.578
has always been our weak spot.

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:03.618
I have neither

00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:06.777
management authority
over international operations

00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:07.537
nor a seat

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:09.578
on the board.

00:05:09.818 --> 00:05:11.217
My dad always doubts my decisions.

00:05:11.818 --> 00:05:13.138
Trying to approach Mr. Baraikin

00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:16.097
unofficially under the company name

00:05:17.897 --> 00:05:18.818
would be

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.297
completely improper.

00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:22.297
So,

00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:23.857
during his stay in China,

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:26.578
I must convince him

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:27.378
to add Jinda

00:05:28.417 --> 00:05:29.258
to his list

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:31.018
of potential partners.

00:05:32.258 --> 00:05:33.537
Once we secure this deal,

00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:36.297
I'll earn my board seat.

00:05:40.618 --> 00:05:42.097
You failed to have a board seat?

00:05:43.058 --> 00:05:45.217
My dad voted against it.

00:05:45.537 --> 00:05:46.178
Why?

00:05:48.378 --> 00:05:49.977
Not the first time he's rejected me.

00:05:52.657 --> 00:05:53.857
I had a child out of wedlock.

00:05:54.657 --> 00:05:55.178
And also,

00:05:55.337 --> 00:05:56.457
I decided on bring Haochen

00:05:56.618 --> 00:05:57.698
home to raise him.

00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:00.537
That caused disagreements with him.

00:06:01.618 --> 00:06:02.738
Since then,

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:05.618
he's never fully trusted me again.

00:06:23.537 --> 00:06:24.337
How's Haochen

00:06:25.498 --> 00:06:26.297
doing lately?

00:06:28.698 --> 00:06:29.738
He is not

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.058
mischievous anymore.

00:06:32.618 --> 00:06:33.417
He's more sensible.

00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:51.818
Would you tell me

00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:54.097
about Haochen's biological mother?

00:07:07.578 --> 00:07:08.857
It's okay if you don't want to.

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:17.897
Actually, I discovered her pregnancy

00:07:20.498 --> 00:07:22.378
two months after I broke up with her.

00:07:23.498 --> 00:07:25.698
I remember it was pouring rain that day.

00:07:26.657 --> 00:07:27.857
She came to find me.

00:07:49.217 --> 00:07:49.897
Have some water.

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:50.938
Thanks.

00:08:03.378 --> 00:08:04.297
Why did you come here?

00:08:14.178 --> 00:08:14.897
I'm pregnant.

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:18.018
The baby is yours.

00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:21.378
I planned to get an abortion,

00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:22.018
but the doctor

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:24.857
said if I terminated this pregnancy,

00:08:25.378 --> 00:08:26.618
I'd never conceive again.

00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:29.618
We broke up months ago.

00:08:31.258 --> 00:08:31.938
Are you kidding?

00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:34.577
You were the only one I'd been with.

00:08:40.218 --> 00:08:40.817
Haoming,

00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:42.138
don't worry.

00:08:42.577 --> 00:08:44.498
I'm just here to inform you

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:46.498
that you have a child.

00:08:47.338 --> 00:08:48.537
Someday I'll tell our child

00:08:48.537 --> 00:08:49.378
he has a father.

00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:52.496
I'm not asking you to be responsible.

00:08:53.657 --> 00:08:54.777
I'll raise the baby alone.

00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:56.978
Alright,

00:08:57.057 --> 00:08:57.738
that's all.

00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:01.577
I'll leave soon.

00:09:02.378 --> 00:09:03.458
Take care, Haoming.

00:09:04.258 --> 00:09:04.978
Don't worry.

00:09:05.018 --> 00:09:05.897
I've decided.

00:09:06.738 --> 00:09:07.738
Since I'm keeping it,

00:09:07.738 --> 00:09:08.978
I can't stay in the dorm.

00:09:09.338 --> 00:09:10.458
I can't tell my dad either,

00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:11.618
or he'd literally kill me.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:12.817
So,

00:09:12.978 --> 00:09:14.697
I'll go to Manchester.

00:09:14.978 --> 00:09:16.618
I have a friend there
and will stay there.

00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:17.777
Anyway,

00:09:18.777 --> 00:09:19.738
I'll have this baby.

00:09:23.018 --> 00:09:23.537
Goodbye.

00:09:34.018 --> 00:09:35.338
I stayed with her throughout

00:09:38.258 --> 00:09:39.577
until the baby was born.

00:09:40.897 --> 00:09:41.618
Unexpectedly,

00:09:41.937 --> 00:09:43.378
shortly after Haochen's birth,

00:09:44.138 --> 00:09:45.858
Fang Yu went diving with friends,

00:09:49.218 --> 00:09:52.537
encountered an ocean current,
and never came back.

00:10:03.697 --> 00:10:05.618
DNA tests confirmed you're the father.

00:10:07.018 --> 00:10:08.498
I brought Haochen back home.

00:10:11.218 --> 00:10:12.777
Perhaps my dad thought this situation

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:15.858
would disrupt the family.

00:10:21.978 --> 00:10:22.817
So we declared

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:25.577
Haochen to be my brother.

00:10:28.817 --> 00:10:29.618
So your dad

00:10:29.618 --> 00:10:31.138
distrusts you

00:10:33.777 --> 00:10:35.338
because of this?

00:10:40.697 --> 00:10:41.657
Do you resent him?

00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:54.937
If you love someone,

00:10:56.258 --> 00:10:57.458
you should trust them

00:10:57.978 --> 00:10:59.057
and believe their actions

00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:00.338
are meant to protect you.

00:11:04.378 --> 00:11:06.057
No matter how old we grow,

00:11:07.618 --> 00:11:08.897
in our elders' eyes,

00:11:08.978 --> 00:11:10.458
we'll always remain children.

00:11:12.897 --> 00:11:14.937
But their distrust doesn't equate

00:11:15.498 --> 00:11:17.577
to indifference or neglect.

00:11:22.218 --> 00:11:22.777
Moreover,

00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:25.098
in such a large corporation,

00:11:26.057 --> 00:11:27.378
so many eyes

00:11:27.577 --> 00:11:28.498
are watching you.

00:11:29.697 --> 00:11:30.937
Any minor mistake you make

00:11:30.978 --> 00:11:32.417
gets magnified exponentially.

00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:34.218
Perhaps your dad believes

00:11:34.657 --> 00:11:35.817
being strict with you

00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:37.904
is better than others taking advantage.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.697
So I think

00:11:40.978 --> 00:11:42.218
his restrictions on you

00:11:43.858 --> 00:11:45.378
might stem from his protection.

00:11:54.177 --> 00:11:55.297
Are you comforting me?

00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:01.978
Yes.

00:12:04.978 --> 00:12:06.417
As a partner,

00:12:07.177 --> 00:12:08.138
I hope you can always

00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:09.458
maintain a good state.

00:12:10.657 --> 00:12:11.618
Finalize the cooperation

00:12:11.618 --> 00:12:12.858
with Mr. Baraikin.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.577
Then I can receive my payment.

00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:18.018
That's it.

00:12:22.338 --> 00:12:23.018
Thank you.

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:26.657
I did feel comforted.

00:12:37.817 --> 00:12:38.738
Go to bed early.

00:12:50.697 --> 00:12:51.978
One more thing.

00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:54.098
About the plan

00:12:54.098 --> 00:12:54.978
for tomorrow?

00:12:55.218 --> 00:12:55.858
No.

00:12:57.657 --> 00:12:59.177
Who exactly invested in you?

00:13:02.177 --> 00:13:03.618
What's it to you?

00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:05.218
Just go to sleep.

00:13:06.657 --> 00:13:07.417
Mr. Huang?

00:13:08.817 --> 00:13:09.498
Ms. Ma?

00:13:11.098 --> 00:13:12.817
Though she has poor judgment,

00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:15.537
she's very interested
in emerging industries.

00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:18.858
Ms. Sun?

00:13:21.537 --> 00:13:22.177
I know

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:23.697
she's always admired you.

00:13:24.577 --> 00:13:26.218
But I don't think it's her.

00:13:27.577 --> 00:13:28.498
Ms. Meng?

00:13:30.657 --> 00:13:31.858
Or my mom?

00:13:34.177 --> 00:13:36.018
Just tell me if it's my mom.

00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:42.537
We're just business partners now.

00:13:44.018 --> 00:13:45.297
Stay out of my affairs.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.098
You have no right to know.

00:13:47.657 --> 00:13:49.057
Stop asking these questions.

00:13:49.498 --> 00:13:50.817
Remember your place.

00:13:54.738 --> 00:13:55.458
Good night.

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:06.177
It's confirmed.

00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:08.577
They're in the cooling-off period.

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:10.256
They'll divorce when it ends.

00:14:11.537 --> 00:14:12.218
Are you sure?

00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:14.338
Pretty sure.

00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:16.297
Alright.

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:18.537
I know what to do now.

00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:41.697
They're having a fight.

00:14:43.138 --> 00:14:45.098
Stop showing off your love.

00:14:45.738 --> 00:14:46.618
Drop the act.

00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:48.777
True colors revealed.

00:15:02.417 --> 00:15:03.657
What's that smell?

00:15:08.978 --> 00:15:10.338
Ethnic-style kites.

00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:11.777
Quite unique.

00:15:12.858 --> 00:15:14.697
Handmade, very beautiful.

00:15:27.897 --> 00:15:28.937
This is nice.

00:15:29.697 --> 00:15:30.697
This is called

00:15:31.177 --> 00:15:32.218
- a sachet.
- Sachet.

00:15:32.657 --> 00:15:33.897
It has a pleasant fragrance.

00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:35.057
Pick one.

00:15:35.057 --> 00:15:36.338
♪That day♪

00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:37.897
The red one looks good.

00:15:38.218 --> 00:15:38.618
This one.

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.897
Peace and contentment
bring the greatest blessings.

00:15:40.978 --> 00:15:41.937
We'll take two of these.

00:15:41.937 --> 00:15:42.498
Thank you.

00:15:43.138 --> 00:15:43.657
You can

00:15:43.697 --> 00:15:44.777
wear it on you

00:15:44.817 --> 00:15:46.057
or attach it to your bag.

00:15:46.138 --> 00:15:47.218
Or put it in your car.

00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:48.417
Since it's a sachet,

00:15:48.537 --> 00:15:49.297
the inside

00:15:49.297 --> 00:15:50.458
contains herbs.

00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:51.057
It's good.

00:15:51.057 --> 00:15:51.417
Okay.

00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:52.417
Thanks.

00:15:52.498 --> 00:15:53.858
This carries different meanings.

00:15:54.098 --> 00:15:54.378
Look,

00:15:55.098 --> 00:15:55.777
these two

00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:57.498
are for you and Mr. Baraikin.

00:15:57.618 --> 00:15:59.018
May you always be happy together.

00:15:59.657 --> 00:16:01.378
Sweetie, you're too kind.

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:02.177
Thank you.

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:05.657
We need two leaves.

00:16:05.817 --> 00:16:06.057
Yes.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.177
Overlap them slightly.

00:16:08.297 --> 00:16:08.897
- Like this?
- Yes.

00:16:09.417 --> 00:16:10.417
Wrap it up this way

00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:11.817
to form a small bowl shape.

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:13.360
Glutinous rice.

00:16:16.314 --> 00:16:20.880
♪May you live in peace♪

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.992

Here is the sweet zongzi you like.

00:16:27.258 --> 00:16:29.577
More dates, less bean paste.

00:16:29.577 --> 00:16:30.177
Right?

00:16:30.537 --> 00:16:31.537
Here you are, honey.

00:16:34.554 --> 00:16:39.351
♪I became even better without you♪

00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:41.643

Look.

00:16:59.897 --> 00:17:01.297
Careful, the filling's spilling.

00:17:07.418 --> 00:17:08.218
Just seal it up.

00:17:13.337 --> 00:17:14.658
My wife made an open-face zongzi.

00:17:15.978 --> 00:17:17.057
See, the teacher made this.

00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:17.938
Seal it up.

00:17:18.018 --> 00:17:18.857
Open-face zongzi.

00:17:18.857 --> 00:17:19.537
Seal it properly.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.698
So sweet.

00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:34.938
Hello, room service for 2130.

00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:43.817
What?

00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:44.857
318, right?

00:17:45.377 --> 00:17:46.458
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:18:07.297 --> 00:18:08.337
What's this?

00:18:10.577 --> 00:18:11.817
This is lip rouge.

00:18:12.178 --> 00:18:13.938
Before the invention of tube lipsticks,

00:18:13.938 --> 00:18:15.978
in ancient times, it served
as lipstick and blush.

00:18:16.537 --> 00:18:18.018
Stored in small containers.

00:18:18.178 --> 00:18:18.938
Dip your finger in.

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.297
It's convenient and charming.

00:18:21.258 --> 00:18:22.857
It comes in various colors. So lovely.

00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:25.218
Do you like it?

00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:26.137
Beautiful.

00:18:27.097 --> 00:18:27.978
And this?

00:18:29.617 --> 00:18:31.817
This is called spiral eyebrow pigment,

00:18:32.418 --> 00:18:34.978
used for eyebrow grooming
in ancient times.

00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:37.018
Its intricate craftsmanship

00:18:37.137 --> 00:18:38.617
made it quite valuable.

00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:43.218
During the Western Han Dynasty,

00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:44.178
an official

00:18:44.337 --> 00:18:45.057
named Zhang Chang

00:18:45.218 --> 00:18:46.218
drew his wife's eyebrows.

00:18:47.137 --> 00:18:47.898
This became known

00:18:47.898 --> 00:18:49.537
as a demonstration of affection

00:18:49.817 --> 00:18:51.218
between husband and wife.

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.418
So, the story of Zhang Chang

00:18:53.418 --> 00:18:54.458
drawing eyebrows was made.

00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:57.337
A husband doing makeup

00:18:57.337 --> 00:18:57.898
for his wife

00:18:58.018 --> 00:18:58.777
was considered

00:18:58.777 --> 00:19:00.337
an intimate act of love.

00:19:02.218 --> 00:19:02.777
Honey,

00:19:04.537 --> 00:19:05.978
let's demonstrate for Mr. Baraikin

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:06.658
and his wife,

00:19:06.777 --> 00:19:07.498
shall we?

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:13.057
Okay.

00:19:21.698 --> 00:19:22.577
She's shy.

00:20:11.137 --> 00:20:11.698
Finished.

00:20:15.418 --> 00:20:16.137
How does it look?

00:20:18.337 --> 00:20:19.498
He is a husband

00:20:19.498 --> 00:20:21.258
who can do makeup for his wife.

00:20:21.738 --> 00:20:22.857
He must love you very much.

00:20:24.097 --> 00:20:25.498
As a Chinese saying goes,

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.097
a lovely couple is

00:20:27.418 --> 00:20:28.577
intimate and sweet.

00:20:29.258 --> 00:20:30.537
It perfectly describes you.

00:20:31.577 --> 00:20:32.978
A happy wife

00:20:33.577 --> 00:20:34.898
makes a happy life.

00:20:35.377 --> 00:20:36.898
Those are your words,

00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:38.617
also my motto from now on.

00:20:39.498 --> 00:20:40.297
Mr. Baraikin.

00:20:40.377 --> 00:20:40.978
Would you

00:20:41.057 --> 00:20:41.898
like to try?

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:44.137
I don't think I can do it.

00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:45.978
Yan.

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:46.738
Do mine.

00:20:47.658 --> 00:20:48.137
Okay.

00:20:49.137 --> 00:20:49.857
Let me try.

00:20:49.978 --> 00:20:50.577
Go grab coffee.

00:20:50.577 --> 00:20:51.617
- Let the ladies enjoy.
- Is this okay?

00:20:51.738 --> 00:20:52.857
We'll find our own fun.

00:20:55.458 --> 00:20:57.018
May I ask

00:20:57.377 --> 00:20:58.898
what you do for a living?

00:20:59.537 --> 00:21:00.817
You're so knowledgeable!

00:21:01.817 --> 00:21:03.898
I was a news anchor before

00:21:04.658 --> 00:21:06.258
and produced food programs.

00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:09.418
No wonder you're so versatile!

00:21:10.817 --> 00:21:11.577
However,

00:21:11.577 --> 00:21:12.698
I've left broadcasting.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.577
With my sister and friends,

00:21:15.777 --> 00:21:17.018
we founded

00:21:17.057 --> 00:21:18.377
an ethnic-inspired fashion brand.

00:21:19.577 --> 00:21:20.738
What I'm wearing

00:21:21.817 --> 00:21:22.337
today

00:21:22.337 --> 00:21:23.738
is our unreleased sample dress.

00:21:24.337 --> 00:21:25.777
No wonder it's exquisite.

00:21:26.658 --> 00:21:27.297
You like it?

00:21:29.337 --> 00:21:30.178
Wait a moment.

00:21:32.097 --> 00:21:34.337
We have brand videos.

00:21:35.057 --> 00:21:35.698
Have a look.

00:21:36.218 --> 00:21:37.297
Here are more

00:21:37.337 --> 00:21:38.498
unreleased designs.

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:39.738
Ethnic-style clothes

00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:41.777
aren't just beautiful

00:21:41.938 --> 00:21:43.857
but culturally precious.

00:21:44.097 --> 00:21:44.777
Today, in cities,

00:21:44.817 --> 00:21:46.137
we rarely see them.

00:21:46.537 --> 00:21:48.137
That's why we created this brand.

00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:50.577
If you'd like,

00:21:50.658 --> 00:21:51.337
just choose one.

00:21:51.418 --> 00:21:52.057
It's my gift.

00:21:53.218 --> 00:21:55.898
How thoughtful!

00:21:56.018 --> 00:21:57.698
You're beautiful, kind,

00:21:57.698 --> 00:21:58.617
and passionate.

00:21:58.738 --> 00:22:00.418
Your husband is lucky to have you.

00:22:05.898 --> 00:22:07.137
What does he do?

00:22:08.938 --> 00:22:10.498
He is Vice President of Jinda Group

00:22:10.857 --> 00:22:11.698
in real estate.

00:22:12.537 --> 00:22:13.817
What a coincidence!

00:22:13.938 --> 00:22:15.777
My husband is also in real estate.

00:22:16.698 --> 00:22:18.018
If my husband knows,

00:22:18.057 --> 00:22:18.738
he will

00:22:18.777 --> 00:22:20.698
share many common topics
with your husband.

00:22:23.938 --> 00:22:25.738
But I made a pact with my husband.

00:22:26.698 --> 00:22:27.777
During the vacation,

00:22:28.418 --> 00:22:29.377
no work is allowed.

00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:31.178
I understand.

00:22:32.258 --> 00:22:33.418
Couples

00:22:33.577 --> 00:22:35.218
rarely can

00:22:35.418 --> 00:22:37.137
get quality time just for themselves.

00:22:37.938 --> 00:22:39.258
Let's skip the work talk then.

00:22:39.418 --> 00:22:40.137
Just have fun.

00:22:44.297 --> 00:22:45.337
Looks great.

00:22:45.377 --> 00:22:45.857
Really?

00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:46.777
Do you like it?

00:22:48.377 --> 00:22:49.498
It's genuinely nice.

00:22:52.498 --> 00:22:53.297
Very good.

00:23:27.938 --> 00:23:30.097
A lie is a lie indeed.

00:23:44.057 --> 00:23:45.698
Are you sure the clothes you chose

00:23:45.898 --> 00:23:47.297
will please Mrs. Baraikin?

00:23:49.057 --> 00:23:50.097
Absolutely.

00:23:50.178 --> 00:23:51.698
Yan Studio's outfits

00:23:51.777 --> 00:23:53.018
are perfect for gifting.

00:24:00.498 --> 00:24:02.178
I think Mrs. Baraikin has probably

00:24:02.258 --> 00:24:03.458
already revealed your identity

00:24:03.458 --> 00:24:04.377
to her husband by now.

00:24:05.337 --> 00:24:06.418
That's perfect.

00:24:06.577 --> 00:24:08.057
We don't have much time left.

00:24:08.297 --> 00:24:09.097
They're leaving

00:24:09.137 --> 00:24:09.938
tomorrow morning.

00:24:12.938 --> 00:24:14.018
But let me remind you.

00:24:15.297 --> 00:24:15.817
Since we've

00:24:15.817 --> 00:24:17.057
prepared so thoroughly,

00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:18.258
we need

00:24:18.258 --> 00:24:19.418
to choose the perfect moment.

00:24:20.978 --> 00:24:21.898
Don't rush

00:24:21.898 --> 00:24:23.218
into business discussions.

00:24:24.178 --> 00:24:24.617
Okay.

00:24:25.018 --> 00:24:25.617
Thank you.

00:24:28.137 --> 00:24:28.978
You don't have to.

00:24:30.418 --> 00:24:31.498
I'm following the contract.

00:24:43.498 --> 00:24:44.738
Regarding the contract,

00:24:45.018 --> 00:24:46.218
I'll make sure to sign it

00:24:46.898 --> 00:24:48.218
with Mr. Baraikin soon.

00:24:49.258 --> 00:24:49.817
Honey.

00:24:50.137 --> 00:24:51.938
Do you like the eyebrows I drew for you?

00:24:53.018 --> 00:24:54.178
Of course, I do.

00:24:54.537 --> 00:24:56.178
But if you make me angry,

00:24:56.297 --> 00:24:57.738
I'll make you do this every day.

00:25:05.498 --> 00:25:07.057
You said you were cold yesterday.

00:25:09.018 --> 00:25:10.258
Let me get you a blanket.

00:25:17.738 --> 00:25:18.258
Thanks.

00:25:21.377 --> 00:25:22.337
Ready to go?

00:25:22.617 --> 00:25:23.057
Let's go.

00:25:27.577 --> 00:25:29.178
This one looks nice.

00:25:42.097 --> 00:25:43.018
So,

00:25:43.018 --> 00:25:44.297
who was hiding in the wardrobe?

00:25:45.297 --> 00:25:46.178
Couldn't see clearly.

00:25:46.738 --> 00:25:47.817
He is probably injured.

00:25:49.938 --> 00:25:52.018
He might be a corporate spy

00:25:52.577 --> 00:25:54.057
targeting the Baraikins.

00:25:57.218 --> 00:25:58.137
Why not expose him

00:25:58.137 --> 00:25:59.057
directly?

00:26:00.018 --> 00:26:01.297
That would alert my opponent.

00:26:02.458 --> 00:26:03.777
Just a corporate spy.

00:26:04.458 --> 00:26:05.458
Our conversation

00:26:05.698 --> 00:26:07.297
didn't reveal any flaws to him.

00:26:07.898 --> 00:26:09.337
If we confront him directly,

00:26:10.218 --> 00:26:11.377
he might get desperate

00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:12.817
and sabotage our plans.

00:26:13.258 --> 00:26:14.337
Just go with it for now.

00:26:17.297 --> 00:26:19.057
It's ready. For you.

00:26:19.408 --> 00:26:21.018
If you like anything else, let me know.

00:26:21.097 --> 00:26:22.018
I'll mail it to you.

00:26:22.377 --> 00:26:23.898
Thank you.

00:26:24.698 --> 00:26:25.938
Shall we have tea together?

00:26:26.057 --> 00:26:26.458
Sure.

00:26:26.658 --> 00:26:27.097
Let's go.

00:26:27.577 --> 00:26:28.377
Thanks.

00:26:32.738 --> 00:26:33.698
The sun's gone now.

00:26:33.698 --> 00:26:34.537
It's cool.

00:26:34.738 --> 00:26:35.178
Sure.

00:26:35.498 --> 00:26:35.898
Very nice.

00:26:35.938 --> 00:26:38.258
This cultural street is wonderful.

00:26:38.617 --> 00:26:39.137
Mr. Baraikin.

00:26:39.137 --> 00:26:39.938
You enjoy it here?

00:26:40.018 --> 00:26:40.777
Mr. Baraikin.

00:26:42.577 --> 00:26:43.018
Steve.

00:26:43.097 --> 00:26:43.857
Mr. Baraikin.

00:26:44.057 --> 00:26:45.178
What happened to you?

00:26:45.658 --> 00:26:46.928
I know you're vacationing here.

00:26:47.418 --> 00:26:48.817
I'm here to take a break too.

00:26:49.377 --> 00:26:50.297
But this place

00:26:50.498 --> 00:26:51.537
isn't welcoming to singles

00:26:51.537 --> 00:26:52.258
like me.

00:26:52.297 --> 00:26:53.297
I had an accident.

00:26:53.658 --> 00:26:54.577
Have a seat.

00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:55.377
Careful.

00:26:55.537 --> 00:26:56.938
I brought you local specialties

00:26:57.137 --> 00:26:58.057
from Jingzhou.

00:26:58.178 --> 00:26:59.696
- Hope you'll like them.
- Thank you.

00:27:05.537 --> 00:27:06.018
So, have you

00:27:06.537 --> 00:27:07.857
been enjoying your time here?

00:27:08.458 --> 00:27:09.097
Sure.

00:27:09.898 --> 00:27:11.577
My wife and I had a wonderful time.

00:27:12.577 --> 00:27:13.297
Most importantly,

00:27:13.297 --> 00:27:14.577
we've made some new friends.

00:27:14.817 --> 00:27:15.857
They're our neighbors.

00:27:20.258 --> 00:27:21.097
Mr. Shen?

00:27:23.097 --> 00:27:23.898
Mr. Shen,

00:27:24.258 --> 00:27:25.018
nice to meet you.

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:26.577
I'm Steve from Situo.

00:27:26.938 --> 00:27:27.698
Do you remember me?

00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:29.258
Yes.

00:27:30.738 --> 00:27:31.178
Hello.

00:27:31.178 --> 00:27:31.698
Hello.

00:27:32.178 --> 00:27:32.458
Sit.

00:27:32.537 --> 00:27:33.498
Do you know each other?

00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:36.377
We met at a summit before

00:27:36.617 --> 00:27:37.498
but once.

00:27:38.218 --> 00:27:38.857
Mr. Shen

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:39.978
is the heir apparent

00:27:39.978 --> 00:27:40.537
of Jinda,

00:27:40.537 --> 00:27:41.777
the leading construction group.

00:27:42.057 --> 00:27:43.178
He is very famous.

00:27:44.377 --> 00:27:45.097
Mr. Shen.

00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:46.777
Haven't you introduced yourself yet?

00:27:47.057 --> 00:27:47.698
I know.

00:27:48.137 --> 00:27:49.498
My wife just told me.

00:27:49.898 --> 00:27:51.297
Mr. Shen, glad to meet you.

00:27:51.777 --> 00:27:53.297
Surprisingly, we're in the same field.

00:27:53.978 --> 00:27:55.057
It's an honor

00:27:55.137 --> 00:27:55.938
to meet you.

00:27:57.018 --> 00:27:58.057
Seeing you two

00:27:58.057 --> 00:27:58.738
vacationing here

00:27:58.738 --> 00:27:59.777
is quite surprising to me.

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.258
There is a rumor about
you two getting divorced.

00:28:02.857 --> 00:28:03.577
Ms. Xu has been

00:28:03.577 --> 00:28:04.658
doing live streams, right?

00:28:10.258 --> 00:28:11.178
Divorce?

00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:13.938
What happened?

00:28:16.498 --> 00:28:18.418
People are spreading rumors again.

00:28:18.617 --> 00:28:19.938
Don't take those seriously.

00:28:22.498 --> 00:28:23.258
My wife

00:28:23.617 --> 00:28:25.738
is hands-on with everything.

00:28:26.018 --> 00:28:27.898
She does live streams
for market research

00:28:27.938 --> 00:28:28.738
on her business.

00:28:30.337 --> 00:28:31.178
Her business?

00:28:31.817 --> 00:28:32.817
As far as I know,

00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:33.498
Ms. Xu

00:28:33.498 --> 00:28:35.057
used to be a financial news anchor.

00:28:35.337 --> 00:28:36.738
Then she switched to a streamer.

00:28:37.738 --> 00:28:38.978
When did you start a business?

00:28:42.178 --> 00:28:43.777
After I quit my job,

00:28:44.297 --> 00:28:45.297
to start a business,

00:28:45.337 --> 00:28:47.617
I entered the live-stream field
to gain experience.

00:28:48.498 --> 00:28:50.537
But finding a new direction

00:28:50.577 --> 00:28:51.458
is challenging.

00:28:51.857 --> 00:28:53.258
Later, I realized it wasn't for me,

00:28:53.938 --> 00:28:55.018
so I quit again.

00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:56.377
I started Yan Studio.

00:28:56.418 --> 00:28:57.537
I told you this afternoon.

00:28:57.978 --> 00:28:58.577
Yes.

00:28:58.698 --> 00:29:00.418
This outfit is a gift from Ms. Xu.

00:29:00.418 --> 00:29:01.297
Chinese-style.

00:29:01.337 --> 00:29:02.018
Very beautiful.

00:29:02.097 --> 00:29:02.577
Thank you.

00:29:02.577 --> 00:29:03.178
Here.

00:29:03.898 --> 00:29:05.178
Mr. Baraikin,

00:29:05.617 --> 00:29:06.938
if you like,

00:29:07.377 --> 00:29:08.698
you can ask my husband.

00:29:08.738 --> 00:29:09.577
My husband loves

00:29:09.577 --> 00:29:10.857
my studio's clothing.

00:29:10.978 --> 00:29:12.057
- Okay.
- Menswear?

00:29:12.777 --> 00:29:13.297
Your size

00:29:13.297 --> 00:29:14.537
should be similar to mine.

00:29:14.777 --> 00:29:15.337
Right?

00:29:15.617 --> 00:29:16.097
Plus size?

00:29:16.097 --> 00:29:17.057
- I guess.
- Probably.

00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:19.057
Mr. Shen and his wife

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:20.297
are indeed very affectionate.

00:29:20.698 --> 00:29:21.418
But,

00:29:22.698 --> 00:29:23.738
Mr. Baraikin, look.

00:29:28.137 --> 00:29:29.698
In Mr. Shen's room,

00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:32.258
there's a pillow and blanket
on the living room sofa.

00:29:33.458 --> 00:29:34.178
Look,

00:29:34.418 --> 00:29:36.938
(toiletries are kept separately.)

00:29:40.978 --> 00:29:42.817
Doesn't this seem odd?

00:29:52.658 --> 00:29:53.537
The splashing game.

00:29:54.577 --> 00:29:56.297
From last night, remember?

00:29:56.938 --> 00:29:58.658
When we played that game,

00:29:58.938 --> 00:29:59.777
she said

00:30:00.258 --> 00:30:02.137
we lacked chemistry.

00:30:02.698 --> 00:30:04.617
She took away my chance
to share a bed with her.

00:30:05.258 --> 00:30:06.137
I told you.

00:30:06.297 --> 00:30:07.617
There's no need to be so serious.

00:30:08.617 --> 00:30:10.377
But you played that game very seriously.

00:30:19.938 --> 00:30:21.658
How did you get those photos?

00:30:23.097 --> 00:30:24.528
If you don't want others to know,

00:30:25.018 --> 00:30:26.337
don't do it in the first place.

00:30:26.857 --> 00:30:28.978
If you two aren't actually separated,

00:30:30.418 --> 00:30:31.178
dare you

00:30:31.817 --> 00:30:33.617
take us to see your bedroom?

00:30:44.698 --> 00:30:45.777
What's going on?

00:30:53.617 --> 00:30:54.057
Well...

00:31:00.337 --> 00:31:01.817
It's beautiful!

00:31:03.418 --> 00:31:03.898
Well,

00:31:04.218 --> 00:31:04.978
this...

00:31:10.458 --> 00:31:11.258
This was

00:31:11.978 --> 00:31:12.978
prepared for Yan

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:13.978
as a surprise.

00:31:15.698 --> 00:31:17.577
They're so romantic!

00:31:19.018 --> 00:31:19.617
Sorry,

00:31:20.777 --> 00:31:22.817
we ruined your surprise.

00:31:25.297 --> 00:31:25.817
It's okay.

00:31:26.938 --> 00:31:28.978
I'm happy spending time
with friends too.

00:31:29.537 --> 00:31:30.377
Mr. Shen,

00:31:31.537 --> 00:31:32.258
I think you have

00:31:32.258 --> 00:31:33.377
potential as a magician.

00:31:34.057 --> 00:31:35.418
You two look close

00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:36.537
outside all the time.

00:31:39.218 --> 00:31:40.297
However,

00:31:42.658 --> 00:31:44.112
you keep a distance at home, right?

00:31:52.817 --> 00:31:53.857
Is there a problem here?

00:31:55.018 --> 00:31:56.297
Weren't you fighting?

00:31:57.777 --> 00:31:58.658
From your perspective,

00:31:58.658 --> 00:31:59.738
this seems like a fight?

00:32:02.658 --> 00:32:03.857
I was doing yoga.

00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:04.777
What?

00:32:05.097 --> 00:32:06.178
My leg wasn't up yet.

00:32:06.898 --> 00:32:07.377
See?

00:32:07.617 --> 00:32:09.898
If you'd kept filming,
my leg would've been lifted.

00:32:10.057 --> 00:32:10.458
Wait.

00:32:10.498 --> 00:32:11.664
Honey, what were you doing?

00:32:12.218 --> 00:32:12.857
I was...

00:32:14.337 --> 00:32:16.057
On a work call with a subordinate.

00:32:16.218 --> 00:32:17.377
Sure, you were on a call.

00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:18.777
I was criticizing him.

00:32:19.057 --> 00:32:20.577
I was kind of emotional.

00:32:20.777 --> 00:32:21.840
- Exactly.
- I was yelling.

00:32:21.938 --> 00:32:23.097
In this direction, like this.

00:32:23.097 --> 00:32:23.418
Sure.

00:32:23.418 --> 00:32:23.888
Like this.

00:32:24.297 --> 00:32:24.938
I was like this,

00:32:25.018 --> 00:32:26.018
lifting my leg.

00:32:26.057 --> 00:32:26.738
Exactly the same.

00:32:26.738 --> 00:32:27.418
Exactly the same.

00:32:27.817 --> 00:32:28.617
Any problem with it?

00:32:29.178 --> 00:32:29.978
- Any problem?
- Any problem?

00:32:32.938 --> 00:32:33.577
Steve,

00:32:34.498 --> 00:32:35.857
what exactly are you trying to do?

00:32:36.458 --> 00:32:38.297
You keep secretly photographing us.

00:32:38.297 --> 00:32:39.258
That's illegal.

00:32:39.258 --> 00:32:41.097
We can call the police.

00:32:41.178 --> 00:32:42.377
Right now.

00:32:49.898 --> 00:32:50.537
Wait.

00:32:52.978 --> 00:32:54.777
This is all a misunderstanding.

00:32:55.458 --> 00:32:56.218
You got me wrong.

00:32:56.658 --> 00:32:57.658
What misunderstanding?

00:33:01.178 --> 00:33:01.857
Let me explain.

00:33:02.577 --> 00:33:03.738
This morning when I woke up,

00:33:03.738 --> 00:33:04.617
I saw a bird

00:33:05.377 --> 00:33:07.218
from my balcony

00:33:07.738 --> 00:33:08.938
and tried to photograph it.

00:33:09.258 --> 00:33:10.057
But accidentally,

00:33:10.057 --> 00:33:10.978
I took a video of you.

00:33:10.978 --> 00:33:12.018
It was accidental.

00:33:12.617 --> 00:33:13.577
It's a misunderstanding.

00:33:14.978 --> 00:33:15.498
Really.

00:33:16.938 --> 00:33:17.458
Well,

00:33:17.938 --> 00:33:18.498
Mr. Shen,

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:19.857
let me make it up

00:33:20.018 --> 00:33:21.137
to you with dinner tonight?

00:33:22.097 --> 00:33:23.137
My treat to apologize.

00:33:31.738 --> 00:33:33.458
You ruined my husband's surprise.

00:33:36.218 --> 00:33:36.658
It's okay.

00:33:37.097 --> 00:33:37.857
Maybe next time.

00:33:45.658 --> 00:33:46.768
I need to use the restroom.

00:33:51.938 --> 00:33:52.658
Ms. Xu.

00:33:56.337 --> 00:33:57.178
Ms. Xu,

00:33:57.857 --> 00:33:59.817
there's something I've been
wanting to tell you.

00:34:01.458 --> 00:34:02.498
I'm a fan of yours.

00:34:03.938 --> 00:34:04.658
Really?

00:34:05.938 --> 00:34:07.258
I loved your Family Feast

00:34:07.418 --> 00:34:08.697
and Financial News.

00:34:08.898 --> 00:34:09.778
I mean it.

00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:11.818
But you suddenly quit.

00:34:11.818 --> 00:34:12.697
I was sad about that.

00:34:13.257 --> 00:34:14.378
I've always wanted to ask

00:34:15.018 --> 00:34:16.137
if you really quit

00:34:16.537 --> 00:34:17.657
just to start a business

00:34:17.778 --> 00:34:18.858
back then.

00:34:18.978 --> 00:34:21.697
I left specifically
to start my own business.

00:34:22.338 --> 00:34:23.338
That's the only reason.

00:34:23.778 --> 00:34:24.498
Thank you.

00:34:24.778 --> 00:34:26.097
It wasn't due to marital issues?

00:34:31.177 --> 00:34:32.177
Don't believe

00:34:32.177 --> 00:34:33.137
those baseless rumors.

00:34:33.978 --> 00:34:35.137
I told you already.

00:34:35.298 --> 00:34:37.137
Rumors gain traction

00:34:38.018 --> 00:34:38.938
for good reasons.

00:34:39.657 --> 00:34:40.577
I've also heard

00:34:41.057 --> 00:34:42.577
you've been scrambling for funding,

00:34:42.938 --> 00:34:44.018
but have some problems.

00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:46.577
Since you suddenly appear here
with Shen Haoming,

00:34:48.858 --> 00:34:50.298
everything makes perfect sense now.

00:34:51.378 --> 00:34:52.978
You're likely pretending

00:34:53.338 --> 00:34:55.978
to be a happy couple
with Shen Haoming for funds.

00:35:01.298 --> 00:35:01.978
I'm sorry.

00:35:06.818 --> 00:35:07.498
I'm sorry.

00:35:08.537 --> 00:35:09.018
I'm sorry.

00:35:09.577 --> 00:35:10.898
I apologize. This is awkward.

00:35:11.057 --> 00:35:11.898
My apologies, truly.

00:35:12.018 --> 00:35:12.898
It's just...

00:35:14.617 --> 00:35:15.577
No offense,

00:35:15.898 --> 00:35:17.137
but is it because of this?

00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:18.938
Your head injury

00:35:18.978 --> 00:35:19.818
makes you

00:35:20.217 --> 00:35:21.378
imagine something?

00:35:24.177 --> 00:35:25.458
In this world,

00:35:26.537 --> 00:35:28.097
no divorced couple

00:35:28.617 --> 00:35:30.657
who have gone through bitter separations

00:35:31.057 --> 00:35:33.018
and hurt each other

00:35:33.177 --> 00:35:34.577
would genuinely wish

00:35:34.938 --> 00:35:36.097
for each other's success

00:35:36.338 --> 00:35:37.818
in business

00:35:38.498 --> 00:35:39.577
and careers.

00:35:42.778 --> 00:35:44.097
Divorced partners

00:35:44.858 --> 00:35:45.978
become sworn enemies.

00:35:48.818 --> 00:35:50.177
If money's your only motive,

00:35:51.257 --> 00:35:52.577
we can invest in you.

00:35:53.657 --> 00:35:54.778
Whatever he offers,

00:35:55.217 --> 00:35:55.938
I'll double it.

00:35:57.097 --> 00:35:58.458
I have one small condition.

00:35:59.057 --> 00:36:00.418
Publicly expose

00:36:00.418 --> 00:36:01.617
your marital fraud

00:36:03.137 --> 00:36:05.018
in front of Mr. Baraikin.

00:36:17.097 --> 00:36:17.978
Ms. Xu,

00:36:19.018 --> 00:36:21.697
why collaborate
with someone you despise?

00:36:23.577 --> 00:36:24.737
Refuse if you want.

00:36:25.657 --> 00:36:27.697
I'll personally unravel your lie.

00:36:28.378 --> 00:36:29.177
In that case,

00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:32.097
Mr. Baraikin won't partner
with Shen Haoming,

00:36:32.617 --> 00:36:34.298
and Shen Haoming's promise
won't be kept.

00:36:34.617 --> 00:36:37.217
My offers will be withdrawn too.

00:36:38.298 --> 00:36:39.298
Ultimately,

00:36:39.657 --> 00:36:41.378
you'll gain nothing.

00:36:42.418 --> 00:36:43.257
Ms. Xu.

00:36:44.177 --> 00:36:45.018
Telling the truth

00:36:46.057 --> 00:36:47.018
isn't that hard.

00:36:48.338 --> 00:36:49.537
Just speak the truth.

00:36:51.057 --> 00:36:52.018
(I'll handle the rest.)

00:36:52.057 --> 00:36:52.617
Yan.

00:36:53.257 --> 00:36:53.818
Yan.

00:36:56.657 --> 00:36:57.617
Let me toast you.

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.577
You look pale.

00:37:00.657 --> 00:37:01.657
Feeling unwell?

00:37:03.257 --> 00:37:03.858
Do I?

00:37:14.257 --> 00:37:16.137
Maybe I drank too quickly.

00:37:16.298 --> 00:37:17.217
Don't worry about me.

00:37:22.617 --> 00:37:24.458
Lemon water helps sober up.

00:37:25.858 --> 00:37:26.418
Thanks.

00:37:27.577 --> 00:37:30.418
Mr. Shen is a good husband.

00:37:34.498 --> 00:37:35.978
Your happy marriage

00:37:36.217 --> 00:37:37.617
is truly enviable.

00:37:38.378 --> 00:37:38.898
However,

00:37:39.418 --> 00:37:40.657
may I ask something?

00:37:41.737 --> 00:37:42.978
Ms. Xu, why are you not

00:37:43.418 --> 00:37:44.818
wearing your wedding ring?

00:37:52.657 --> 00:37:53.537
Wedding rings

00:37:54.097 --> 00:37:55.057
symbolize

00:37:55.057 --> 00:37:55.938
marital commitment.

00:37:56.298 --> 00:37:58.418
It explains the rumors

00:37:58.498 --> 00:37:59.338
about your divorce.

00:38:00.177 --> 00:38:01.778
If you're happy,

00:38:02.818 --> 00:38:04.418
why forget your wedding ring?

00:38:06.898 --> 00:38:07.778
Good point.

00:38:08.498 --> 00:38:09.137
See?

00:38:09.697 --> 00:38:12.097
This is my wedding ring.

00:38:12.498 --> 00:38:14.177
We bought it before our wedding.

00:38:14.537 --> 00:38:16.378
It's not very expensive,

00:38:16.418 --> 00:38:17.818
but I have been wearing it.

00:38:17.898 --> 00:38:19.338
It's priceless to me.

00:38:20.177 --> 00:38:21.217
Why is yours not on?

00:38:31.617 --> 00:38:32.858
In fact, I planned

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.537
to make this trip

00:38:36.298 --> 00:38:38.217
to make it up to Yan.

00:38:43.097 --> 00:38:43.938
Our marriage

00:38:43.938 --> 00:38:45.458
has indeed encountered some issues.

00:38:49.818 --> 00:38:51.057
I wasn't mature enough.

00:38:52.458 --> 00:38:53.338
I did many things

00:38:53.737 --> 00:38:55.257
that hurt Yan deeply.

00:38:57.978 --> 00:38:59.458
A rift formed between us.

00:39:02.418 --> 00:39:03.418
We've been giving

00:39:04.432 --> 00:39:05.778
each other the silent treatment.

00:39:08.298 --> 00:39:09.577
During that time,

00:39:11.898 --> 00:39:13.577
memories of the past kept resurfacing.

00:39:18.898 --> 00:39:20.938
When I faced challenges at work,

00:39:22.697 --> 00:39:23.737
she stayed by my side,

00:39:24.458 --> 00:39:25.378
fighting alongside me.

00:39:30.537 --> 00:39:31.617
When someone tried

00:39:31.657 --> 00:39:33.097
to harm me,

00:39:34.938 --> 00:39:36.137
she didn't hesitate

00:39:36.938 --> 00:39:38.057
to shield me

00:39:39.818 --> 00:39:40.737
from any harm.

00:39:43.657 --> 00:39:44.938
When I focused on work

00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:46.177
and couldn't spare time,

00:39:47.858 --> 00:39:49.577
she lovingly cared for my parents

00:39:51.298 --> 00:39:52.338
and my brother.

00:39:54.577 --> 00:39:56.018
Her devotion to the family

00:39:58.378 --> 00:39:59.577
surpassed mine.

00:40:03.617 --> 00:40:04.898
During this time,

00:40:07.818 --> 00:40:08.737
I realized

00:40:10.378 --> 00:40:11.617
how deeply

00:40:12.818 --> 00:40:14.257
I miss her.

00:40:19.378 --> 00:40:20.498
And I came to know

00:40:22.418 --> 00:40:24.418
how crucial you are to me.

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.257
I'd like both of you

00:40:35.498 --> 00:40:36.657
to witness this moment.

00:40:44.697 --> 00:40:45.697
Throughout this trip,

00:40:47.858 --> 00:40:49.378
I've carried this ring with me.

00:40:59.097 --> 00:41:00.458
Please forgive me

00:41:02.657 --> 00:41:04.217
and give me another chance. Will you?

00:41:11.057 --> 00:41:12.298
(Refuse if you want.)

00:41:13.858 --> 00:41:15.898
(I'll personally unravel your lie.)

00:41:17.737 --> 00:41:18.697
(In that case,)

00:41:19.257 --> 00:41:21.418
(Mr. Baraikin won't partner
with Shen Haoming,)

00:41:23.537 --> 00:41:25.257
(and Shen Haoming's promise
won't be kept.)

00:41:25.537 --> 00:41:28.177
(My offers will be withdrawn too.)

00:41:30.418 --> 00:41:31.378
(Ultimately,)

00:41:32.338 --> 00:41:34.018
(you'll gain nothing.)

00:41:41.577 --> 00:41:42.858
Don't let this happen again.

00:41:47.657 --> 00:41:48.378
Absolutely not.

00:41:51.546 --> 00:41:56.040
♪I'm giving it all,
just getting nothing back♪

00:41:58.418 --> 00:42:00.177
Couples always have arguments,

00:42:01.097 --> 00:42:02.617
just like me and my wife.

00:42:03.097 --> 00:42:03.737
But

00:42:04.257 --> 00:42:05.097
we never

00:42:05.137 --> 00:42:06.938
let any misunderstanding

00:42:07.137 --> 00:42:08.498
truly separate us.

00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:12.737
I hope you'll reconcile completely.

00:42:13.577 --> 00:42:15.537
There's a Russian proverb,

00:42:16.137 --> 00:42:18.137
"Don't let the unchangeable past

00:42:18.537 --> 00:42:20.617
affect your present and future."

00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:22.577
Thank you for the advice.

00:42:23.257 --> 00:42:23.818
From now on,

00:42:24.177 --> 00:42:25.217
I'll strive to learn

00:42:25.938 --> 00:42:27.018
how to be a better husband

00:42:28.338 --> 00:42:29.737
and love my wife.

00:42:39.378 --> 00:42:40.018
Ms. Xu.

00:42:40.378 --> 00:42:42.458
If you've forgiven Mr. Shen,

00:42:42.978 --> 00:42:43.978
then

00:42:44.418 --> 00:42:45.858
shouldn't you kiss now?

00:43:12.537 --> 00:43:13.338
Excuse us.

00:43:18.097 --> 00:43:19.737
Our vacation ends tomorrow.

00:43:19.978 --> 00:43:21.097
We need to return early.

00:43:21.257 --> 00:43:22.617
Let's call it a day.

00:43:23.378 --> 00:43:24.298
Have a good rest.

00:43:24.418 --> 00:43:25.584
- We'll see you off.
- Okay.

00:43:25.818 --> 00:43:26.537
See you tomorrow.

00:43:26.818 --> 00:43:27.378
Dear.

00:43:27.737 --> 00:43:28.097
Bye.

00:43:28.378 --> 00:43:28.737
Bye.

00:43:33.898 --> 00:43:34.378
What?

00:43:34.498 --> 00:43:35.217
You stay.

00:43:35.577 --> 00:43:36.418
Bandage your wound.

00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:37.217
I can't drink.

00:43:37.818 --> 00:43:38.097
Stop.

00:43:38.097 --> 00:43:38.418
You can.

00:43:38.418 --> 00:43:39.338
Let's sit and talk.

00:43:39.338 --> 00:43:40.097
You were talkative.

00:43:40.577 --> 00:43:41.018
What?

00:43:41.097 --> 00:43:41.498
Sit.

00:43:41.978 --> 00:43:43.097
Let me redress your wound.

00:43:43.338 --> 00:43:43.617
Come.

00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:02.338
It looks lovely

00:44:02.378 --> 00:44:03.298
and suits you.

00:44:03.338 --> 00:44:04.938
I really like it.

00:44:05.898 --> 00:44:08.018
Having you here made my vacation

00:44:08.137 --> 00:44:09.537
truly joyful.

00:44:11.257 --> 00:44:13.378
Treasure each other dearly.

00:44:14.257 --> 00:44:15.338
Last night's kiss

00:44:15.617 --> 00:44:16.818
overflowed with genuine love.

00:44:16.858 --> 00:44:18.418
It clearly wasn't an act.

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.577
Whenever you return home,

00:44:21.737 --> 00:44:22.537
do let me know.

00:44:23.257 --> 00:44:23.778
I will.

00:44:23.778 --> 00:44:24.858
We're friends now.

00:44:25.577 --> 00:44:26.338
Be safe.

00:44:26.657 --> 00:44:27.378
- See you.
- Next time,

00:44:27.778 --> 00:44:29.018
we must play golf together.

00:44:29.498 --> 00:44:29.978
Okay.

00:44:31.298 --> 00:44:31.978
Mr. Shen.

00:44:32.898 --> 00:44:34.458
I admire your composure.

00:44:34.898 --> 00:44:36.498
You've remained patient,

00:44:36.737 --> 00:44:38.737
never mentioning work matters.

00:44:39.498 --> 00:44:40.498
That's good.

00:44:41.778 --> 00:44:43.537
Since we met

00:44:43.577 --> 00:44:44.978
and got along so well,

00:44:45.537 --> 00:44:47.057
whatever your intention is,

00:44:47.177 --> 00:44:48.737
I'd love to hear about it.

00:44:50.378 --> 00:44:51.458
The vacation is over.

00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:53.818
Can you consider adding Jinda

00:44:53.978 --> 00:44:54.737
to the list

00:44:55.217 --> 00:44:56.898
for potential partners?

00:44:57.697 --> 00:44:58.858
I've heard

00:44:58.978 --> 00:45:00.018
Jinda is

00:45:00.018 --> 00:45:01.898
an excellent real estate company.

00:45:03.577 --> 00:45:04.737
I'll wait for your call.

00:45:05.577 --> 00:45:06.898
Don't forget our agreement.

00:45:07.177 --> 00:45:08.338
Whether you come to Russia

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:09.577
or I visit China,

00:45:09.898 --> 00:45:11.737
we'll treat each other generously.

00:45:12.018 --> 00:45:12.537
Of course.

00:45:13.458 --> 00:45:14.057
Goodbye.

00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:15.057
Goodbye.

00:45:33.657 --> 00:45:34.257
Mr. Shen.

00:45:35.498 --> 00:45:36.938
I've completed my task.

00:45:37.978 --> 00:45:38.978
You did a great job.

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:40.657
Alright then.

00:45:41.097 --> 00:45:42.057
I'll head back soon.

00:45:42.938 --> 00:45:43.600
I'll drive you.

00:45:48.978 --> 00:45:49.537
What's wrong?

00:45:59.537 --> 00:46:00.097
Sorry,

00:46:00.617 --> 00:46:01.904
I got used to holding your hand.

00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:05.737
You can change this habit.

00:46:10.938 --> 00:46:12.298
I'll take you home anyway.
