Xi,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.460
don't you think

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.510
you should explain yourself to me?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.430
Xi?

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.500
Father, what do you

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.460
mean by that?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.210
What do I mean?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.360
The Crown Prince's poisoning was fake.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.030
The Red-armored Army's token
was also fake.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.210
Could it be

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.960
you're working with them?

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.380
I failed to discover
the Crown Prince's scheme.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.700
That was my fault.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640
But if I had ill intentions toward you,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.210
I wouldn't have taken Ruoyao hostage

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.470
to come rescue you.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.500
I am loyal

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.650
to you, Father.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.820

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:45.420
Forget it.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.360
They think

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.930
that I've lost the Red-armored Army

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.289
and my weapons

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.039
so I'm

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.539
out of options now?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.700

Your Highness.

Zhou Kui's troops left the city

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.500
and then disappeared.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.360
We don't know where he went.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.590
Keep searching!

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.600

around the Imperial City!

Why do you think Zhou Ruoxi

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.820
suddenly appeared

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.520
and took Ruoyao hostage?

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.640
I thought Zhou Ruoxi replaced the poison

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.490
because she shared our goals.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.550
Who knew she would turn against us

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.930

Today Xi helped Zhou Kui escape.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.030
She must have decided to be our enemy.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.140
But something still feels wrong.

none of them concerns you.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.500
You should leave this place

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.540

I'm fine.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.940

Don't worry.

We've just gotten married.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.500
I wouldn't bear

to leave you alone.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.810
Alright.

not only will Brother go mad,

but

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.880
other troubles might follow.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.830
I'll go now.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.380
Yan,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.680
have you considered

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.320
that Zhou Kui might not leave at all,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.100
but instead burn his bridges

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.360
and fight to win or die?

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.850
Do you know anything else?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.750
Do you know

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.550
how His Majesty died

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.140
in the previous life?

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.840
In the 11th year of Xinshou reign,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.600
His Majesty fell gravely ill

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.930
and when he was on his deathbed,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.190
he passed the throne to the Crown Prince.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.650
But His Majesty had always
been in good health.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.650
How could he suddenly become so ill?

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.180
Are you saying

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.890
Father was also killed by Zhou Kui?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.780
Although there's no concrete evidence,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.750
thinking about it carefully now,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.700
it could indeed
have been Zhou Kui's doing.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.720
At that time,

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:59.120
I had already married Li Shu

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.850
and became the Crown Princess.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.650
After His Majesty passed away,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.780
he left the throne to the Crown Prince.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.230
And I became the mistress
of the imperial harem.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.360
Zhou Kui used my position as Empress

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.890
to throw his weight around.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.140
Plus, I saw Linglan

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.960
secretly meeting with
someone from the palace.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.230
Zhou Kui must have planted spies
around His Majesty,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.360
otherwise he couldn't have done this.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.530
Then I'll go to the palace

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.210
and warn Father to be more vigilant.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.970
Also,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.010
increase patrols inside the Imperial City.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.340
Post guards at the city gates.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.670
I feel Zhou Kui still
has some backup plan.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.390
I'll be going then.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.640

or fake imperial orders.]

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.240

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.810

Please punish me.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.600
This mistake

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.430
is beyond your power alone to rectify.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.160
what should we do next?

Proceed as planned.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.760
As for the rest,

-Yes.

to Your Majesty.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.160
You actually conspired with an outsider

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.320
to harm me?

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.120
Outsider?

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.410
Lord Zhou

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.300
is my own brother.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.490
The chief steward by His Majesty's side

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.530
is actually my father's brother.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.370
No wonder we could
enter the palace so easily.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.840
It's been so long.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.860
Why hasn't Father summoned me yet?

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.720
Something's wrong.

[Crown Prince's Mansion]

What is it?

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.920
His Highness has been to the palace
for a long time

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.320
and hasn't returned yet.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.860

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.210
I'll send someone to the palace right away

Your Grace,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.600
I was patrolling the city as ordered

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.160
and discovered something suspicious.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.960
What is it?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.600
Near the Imperial City,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.410
there seems to be the smell of gunpowder.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.910
I just sent someone to investigate

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.170
and found traces of sulfur and charcoal.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.660
It's not the Fireworks Festival.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.720
Why would there be gunpowder and charcoal?

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.250
Gunpowder and charcoal...

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.760
Lieutenant Liang,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:20.950
are you certain?

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.650
I smelled it clearly.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.650
My hometown is known
for gunpowder production.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.270
Since childhood,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.000
I grew up surrounded
by black powder and fire caltrops.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.730
Most people wouldn't notice this smell,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.530
but I recognize it immediately.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.490
Lieutenant Liang,

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.030
I need you to do something for me.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.580
This dragon throne

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.240
is truly magnificent.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.200
It's comfortable to sit on too.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.120
No wonder so many people

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.320
fight desperately

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.120
to sit on this throne.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.560
You've sat here long enough.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.600
Make way

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.620
and let someone else have a turn.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.220
Zhou Kui,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.400
how dare you!

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.510
A mere Minister of Rites

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.750
with ambitions to usurp the throne.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.370
Usurp?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.080
The empire

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.540
belongs to the virtuous.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.140
In both civil and military affairs,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.700
I can say without doubt

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.100
that I'm second to none.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.970
Why shouldn't this empire

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.390
be mine to rule?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.210
Not to mention that since 30 years ago,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.020
Yunrui should have been destroyed.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.000
This should have been mine all along!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.910
If you hadn't supported the Daqing rebels,

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.460
how would I have ended up like this?

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.960
You are...

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.820
the Crown Prince
of the former Daqing dynasty?

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.720
30 years.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.420
It has been 30 years.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.230
No one has addressed me that way.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.960
But the good thing is

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.140
now I've returned to this court

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.040
and sit on this dragon throne!

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.560
Get off my throne now!

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.550
You'd better understand the situation.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.640
Now

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.110
it's not up to you.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.400
Zhou Kui,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.460
Yunrui has never mistreated you.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.150
I have treated you well.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.120
Why would you do this?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.440
Shut up!

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.470
For you,

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.940
titles and rewards

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.810
are the greatest gifts!

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:54.950
But for me...

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.280
For me,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.480
I can't forget all these years

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.740
of humiliation,
begging at your feet like a dog.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.090
I will avenge this shame

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.510
and reclaim the throne!

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.840
I want Yunrui's empire

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.540
to exact my revenge.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.970
I

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.260
will not let you have your way.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.660
Now,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.160
you

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.980
and your son

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.570
are both in my hands.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.680
You have no choice but to comply.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.880
My Li family

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.760
only has martyrs who protect the state,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.880
not hostages who fear death.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.040
Well said!

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.840
Good!

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.870
Such eloquent words

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.240
and noble integrity.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.390
But have you considered?

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.450
What if

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.340
I take the citizens of the Imperial City

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.860
as hostages?

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.490
What would you do then?

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.120
What did you say?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.360
Are you saying

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.910
Zhou Kui planted explosives
in the Imperial City?

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.350
Yes.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.390
Your Highness,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.960
we should hurry to the palace.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.740
I'm really worried about Prince Yan.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.300
Alright.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.160
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.450
By order of His Majesty,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.300
the Crown Prince and his party

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.390
are to enter the palace immediately.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.800
Your Majesty,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.670
the life and death of

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.350
tens of thousands of citizens

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.250
in the Imperial City Qingzhou

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.360
depends solely

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.980
on Your Majesty's decision.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.130
Zhou Kui,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.740
what exactly are you trying to do?

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.790
He planted explosives
around the Imperial City!

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.350
Fu Wei.
