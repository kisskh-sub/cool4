=Episode 23=
(Time to Say Goodbye)

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
We are sorry about the past.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.680
Years ago,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.680
Mother made a misguided choice

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.480
that led to the tragedy of your family.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.840
If you're willing to let it go,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.040
we'll devote everything we have

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080
to atone for our past mistakes.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.440
We'll help you

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.880
rebuild your family's tea estate.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.440
Miss Gu.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.760
I'll just call you Niaoniao.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.360
I know

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.200
deep down you're not wicked.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.760
You don't genuinely want to kill people.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.480
You've helped us countless times before.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.840
I believe your father

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.240
wouldn't want his daughter

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.920
to live in hatred.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.440
He would surely wish his only daughter

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.440
in this world

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to live happily

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.560
and let go of hatred.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.640
Let it go.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.560
Start anew.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.080
What's more,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.880
I'll help you open a milk tea shop.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.880
Alright?

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.040
Our ancestors also worked hard on
operating small tea shops.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.160
They relied on mutual support.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920
We can do the same.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.760
Miss Gu.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.560
Just tell us,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.120
and we'll always be here.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.280
Father, what's this?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.080
This is called a tea whisk.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.040
Tea whisk?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.160
What's it used for?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.760
This is

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.280
for frothing the tea.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.240
Yaoyao.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.880
Just put it down.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.720
Let me make tea for you.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.880
Put it down, Yaoyao.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.120
Put it down.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.280
Put it down.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.120
Look, she's asleep.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.480
(Father, we can finally go home.)

00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:22.432
(Top Milk Tea)

00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:30.272
(Gu's Tea House)

00:03:45.344 --> 00:03:48.800
(Top Milk Tea)

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:06.880
(Happiness)

00:04:18.272 --> 00:04:19.904
(Happiness)

00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:27.360
(Happiness)

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.880
I learned it from Mr. Qi.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.240
I never expected

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.960
that your cherished first love

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.240
would be Wei Xiaotang.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.280
So,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.160
it's meant to be like this.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.640
The whole story

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.160
has a perfect ending, anyway.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.400
After I return,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.640
I'll give Wei Xiaotang back to you.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.360
This time,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560
will you really go back?

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.040
(My goal is to win the Top Tea title.)

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.760
If I fail,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.040
I can't return home.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.080
Then stay with me

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.480
until we win the Top Tea title.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.120
It's time to go back.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.680
So,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.200
how exactly will you return?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.080
By boat or carriage?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.080
The journey must be long.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.880
Let me accompany you.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.680
Strangely,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.280
the place I'm returning to

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.080
is where fifteen-year-old Li Zixuan

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.440
first met Wei Xiaotang by the river.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.280
The stars tonight are beautiful.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.240
After you return,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.240
will the stars we see

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.560
still be the same?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.800
They must be.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.760
The stars we see now

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.760
might be the same ones
over a millennium ago.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.240
Actually, I feel

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.320
being Wei Xiaotang these days

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.760
has been rather joyful.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.400
I'm also happy.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.920
After I leave,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.120
don't overwork yourself.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.200
Also,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.472
the Top Tea

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.760
is just a game setting.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.560
From now on,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.440
just be true to who you are.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.480
Alright.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.240
You take care.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.560
And one more thing,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.960
when seeing a girl you fancy,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.000
treat her well.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.240
Don't be impulsive

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.120
every time

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.360
something happens.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.000
Xiaotang.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.200
Stay.
