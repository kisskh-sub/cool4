WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:53.999
You actually pulled it off, huh?

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:55.209
Congrats.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.072
What's with that face?

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.999
This is no different from a business.
I took it too lightly.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:04.775
I was lucky this time.

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:07.584
If it weren't for those bastards,
I would've failed.

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:12.482
Even if a store has a great product,
if people aren't aware,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.959
it just becomes dead stock.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.513
And so, they do
discounts and promotions,

00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:20.626
and keep shifting the display
to catch people's attention.

00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:23.048
You're saying we need to promote?

00:01:23.087 --> 00:01:25.071
Women always talk about drama.

00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:27.999
I want junkies to always talk about us.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.895
A buzz,
that's what we need.

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:34.971
It looks like a delivery app ad.

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.999
Magical Pill — Vaca
First purchase: 100 won

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.999
Limited sale for ten days.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.500
Don't miss it.

00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:45.999
Our word is spreading fast.

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:47.542
Did you get the link?

00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:48.999
Go on, it's only 100 won.

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.358
- Is it real?
- Awesome.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:53.667
Even billionaires love good deals.

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:56.083
Nobody hates free stuff, right?

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.834
And then what?

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:00.417
Here you are.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.042
We expand our customer base.

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:08.792
Attention - a secret deal for
returning customers only.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:14.999
Refer a friend on repurchase
and get double the amount you ordered.

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.934
A one-time offer.
Don't miss it.

00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.999
We build our customer base,
and when the repurchase rate tops 30%,

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:24.403
that's when we raise the price.

00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:26.626
By how much?
800k per gram?

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:27.934
1 million.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.160
Marketing is all about
attracting customers to our shop.

00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:35.834
What's the essence?
Don't be led by change.

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:37.523
- Instead, create the change.
- Instead, create the change.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:38.959
Shall we read it together?

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.000
There's something I learned
while working at the bank.

00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:45.959
Marketing isn't about
following change.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.042
It's about creating it.

00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:49.918
Welcome.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.000
Thank you.

00:02:55.268 --> 00:02:57.268
You look so young today.

00:02:57.918 --> 00:02:59.250
Nice to see you again.

00:03:17.693 --> 00:03:19.794
Damn, is it jammed again?

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.375
Wow!

00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:35.996
What are you, woman?

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.667
Were you the salesperson
of the month or something?

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:41.120
Pretty much.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.296
9.5 million in total.

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.999
You get...

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.042
6.65 million won.

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:57.417
And I get 2.85 million won.
Nice round numbers.

00:03:57.626 --> 00:03:58.751
Why did you quit?

00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:01.999
Because I was a high school graduate.

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:11.684
Hi.

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:13.542
Is your mother home?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.999
EPISODE 5

00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:44.646
Oh, thank you.

00:04:48.584 --> 00:04:51.709
You remember me, right?
I came to catch a thief.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:53.375
Yes.

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.057
Did you catch him?

00:04:58.042 --> 00:05:02.459
Yeah, but we couldn't find
the stolen goods.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.918
Looks like someone
snatched them in between.

00:05:09.053 --> 00:05:10.772
Do you know anyone...

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:15.584
...called James?

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:38.556
Nice new car,

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:41.486
just like the lawyer
you introduced me to.

00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:56.341
I delayed the urine test,

00:05:56.372 --> 00:06:00.042
bleached and waxed like you said,
and my results came back negative.

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:01.999
How can you be so perfect?

00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:04.417
My after-sales service is on point.

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:07.391
Yes, I've heard of him.

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:11.167
He worked at Medusa.
I did part-time cleaning there.

00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:12.856
I'm sure you knew, right?

00:06:14.626 --> 00:06:19.417
- So, no personal connection?
- Pretty much.

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:22.929
I was a cleaner,
and he was much higher up.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.203
I thought so too.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.626
But how can your number
be on James's call log?

00:06:51.225 --> 00:06:54.000
Oh, there was this one time.

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:59.542
I found his phone
and returned it to him.

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:01.999
He had two phones.

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.205
I think most of the managers
were the same.

00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:08.999
I picked one up while cleaning.

00:07:10.736 --> 00:07:14.999
So you quitting on the day
James disappeared is...

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.750
- ...just a coincidence?
- Did he?

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:20.871
Yes.

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:35.006
- You're about 165 cm tall, right?
- How'd you know?

00:07:35.124 --> 00:07:37.459
I have good eyes.

00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:40.256
Tell me about
what you did on the 22nd.

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:41.476
Why?

00:07:45.124 --> 00:07:48.094
There's a suspect we think
was working with James.

00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:54.326
You kind of... look like her.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:59.918
Even the scarf is similar
to that one.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.752
Nice.
Simple and handy.

00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:16.783
So, are you working alone?

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.033
I have a partner
who'll be quitting soon.

00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:22.334
You're not sad, are you?

00:08:25.662 --> 00:08:28.170
Damn, nice shot!

00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:30.999
My partner's pretty capable.
Works hard and does well.

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:33.287
A potential decoy if needed.

00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:45.782
Then convince otherwise.

00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:52.843
Nice shot!

00:08:55.335 --> 00:09:00.339
I went from the hospital to my job.
You can check if you want.

00:09:00.862 --> 00:09:01.999
What about that scarf?

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:05.083
Bought it at the station for 10,000 won.
The store's still there.

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.959
- So this isn't you?
- No, it's not.

00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:22.408
My apologies.
I thought you and James were close.

00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:24.999
Even ran a background check on you.

00:09:25.952 --> 00:09:29.287
And as you just mentioned,

00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:32.901
I found out your husband's very ill.

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.172
Medical bills seemed hefty.

00:09:35.297 --> 00:09:39.610
Definitely not enough
to be covered working part-time

00:09:39.672 --> 00:09:40.999
at a supermarket.

00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:42.999
I borrowed money from all over!

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:47.340
Why are you asking me this?
Did I do something wrong?

00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:53.167
No, no.
Just routine questions.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:54.125
Occupational habit.

00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:01.388
- I need the restroom.
- Sure, go ahead.

00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:40.718
Plum extract?
Did you make this yourself?

00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:41.952
Yes.

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:43.804
Very frugal of you.

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:47.248
Why would someone
like you do that?

00:11:47.514 --> 00:11:48.822
Do what?

00:11:53.975 --> 00:11:56.310
Kim Minwoo,
the other manager at Medusa.

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:05.999
You called him to the restroom,

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.872
and like... took your clothes off.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.397
Just a moment.

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.000
Ma'am.

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:33.116
Here's what I think.

00:12:33.751 --> 00:12:35.999
No one starts out at rock bottom.

00:12:36.391 --> 00:12:40.600
Life just puts you there.

00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:44.518
Stealing out of greed
versus stealing for your family...

00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:48.999
At first, they seem very different.

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:52.242
But in the end, it's the same.

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:58.042
Both are theft, all the same.

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:02.834
Making someone yours is easy.

00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:05.959
Find their weakness and
stoke their desires.

00:13:06.597 --> 00:13:10.999
Once a craving is filled,
people can never go back.

00:13:12.198 --> 00:13:13.183
Speaking from experience?

00:13:41.263 --> 00:13:45.482
Be honest, and I'll make sure
your family never knows.

00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:08.167
Well, the truth is...

00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:19.266
I used to raise a dog.

00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:24.083
The poor thing couldn't fit in anywhere,
so I took care of it.

00:14:24.887 --> 00:14:28.834
I fed it and gave it attention.
Soon, it was ready to die for me.

00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:31.334
You know... loyalty.

00:14:33.896 --> 00:14:34.892
Did it die for you?

00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:39.667
Nice shot.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.986
Pretty much.

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:46.542
We got high
and ran into a problem.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.732
Nothing big, just a few candies.
Then one guy overdosed, right?

00:14:51.927 --> 00:14:54.232
Cops came, and I thought
we were all screwed.

00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:57.607
But only the dog
took the fall.

00:14:59.693 --> 00:15:02.287
Only he ended up in jail.
Nice and neat.

00:15:03.999 --> 00:15:05.459
Hope he's doing all right.

00:15:07.748 --> 00:15:08.914
Hey, get me some water.

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:14.923
He said there's an easier way
to make big money.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:20.584
That they even take people
in their thirties and forties.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:29.859
He was the guy
who called in the hookers.

00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:35.249
But when it came down to it,
I just couldn't.

00:15:36.263 --> 00:15:37.975
I kept thinking of my daughter.

00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:44.573
I said no, and he suddenly
jumped onto me.

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.976
My family doesn't know it.

00:15:54.973 --> 00:15:58.432
How would my husband
and my girl think of me?

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:04.417
I have to keep this a secret.
Forever.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.626
I'm begging you.

00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:47.037
Excuse me,
I need the restroom...

00:16:47.068 --> 00:16:51.755
Wait, my partner's got constipation.
It's really bad.

00:16:51.794 --> 00:16:56.459
Could I get another glass of water?

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:05.667
Wait, um...

00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:10.676
Are you alright?

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.123
Is everything...

00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:23.748
Sorry, I have diarrhea.

00:17:24.537 --> 00:17:25.542
Not constipation?

00:17:25.584 --> 00:17:29.083
Both.
Constipation and diarrhea.

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.000
You really found nothing?

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:36.417
Nope.

00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:38.999
Nothing related to James?

00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:42.417
No money, no drugs, nothing?

00:18:42.999 --> 00:18:44.257
No, nothing at all.

00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:47.209
You still suspect her?

00:18:58.167 --> 00:18:59.999
Making gochujang stew?

00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:02.083
Chop up some veggies
and throw them in.

00:19:10.953 --> 00:19:11.723
Mom.

00:19:12.942 --> 00:19:16.559
In my hometown,
gochujang stew is a special dish.

00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:19.731
- Mom?
- Yeah.

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:21.930
Why are you dazed out?

00:19:24.156 --> 00:19:25.914
Sorry.

00:19:26.156 --> 00:19:28.584
You've been like this
ever since the police came.

00:19:29.594 --> 00:19:35.238
I must've been shaken.
The police came into our house!

00:19:35.293 --> 00:19:39.582
I hope they catch
the culprit soon, right?

00:19:41.199 --> 00:19:46.221
Mom, can a person be both
really good and really bad?

00:19:46.994 --> 00:19:47.626
Huh?

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:53.111
We get along well, she's funny,
and she's very caring.

00:19:53.334 --> 00:19:56.263
But sometimes,
she's very mean and dark.

00:19:56.928 --> 00:19:58.388
- Dark?
- Yeah.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.125
It's hard to explain.

00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:03.661
Anyway, she really confuses me.

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:06.334
Is she a good or bad person?

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:10.500
Should I like her?
Or should I hate her?

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:14.083
I was suspicious too.
But her record's clean,

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:17.999
she has a good reputation,
and is devoted to her sick husband.

00:20:17.999 --> 00:20:20.489
The more I see it,
the more I feel we were wrong.

00:20:21.223 --> 00:20:23.707
My uncle passed from
pancreatic cancer too.

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:26.278
I saw how much
my cousin's family suffered.

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:27.876
You're just wishing she was clean.

00:20:27.918 --> 00:20:30.709
We can't get a warrant
without solid evidence.

00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.542
James is in hiding too.

00:20:32.584 --> 00:20:34.792
How about we focus on Phantom again?

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:37.375
They could be pretending
to have lost their drugs.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:38.570
No, that's not it.

00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:42.918
There it is.
Your all-seeing eye.

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:45.334
Did you know
people call you the shaman?

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.792
What's your sixth sense telling you?

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.626
If your kid were starving to death,

00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:56.999
you'd do anything to feed them,
even steal.

00:20:56.999 --> 00:20:59.375
So you think Kang Eunsoo is the same?

00:20:59.732 --> 00:21:00.981
My experiences tell me

00:21:01.125 --> 00:21:05.626
that desperate people are the scariest
and the most ruthless.

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.542
If you put it that way,
I can't disagree.

00:21:07.584 --> 00:21:11.542
That's how crime starts.
Then it spreads.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:15.667
Like zombies.
With no vaccine or cure.

00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:20.626
Once bitten, you can't go back.
You just keep doing it.

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:22.667
On and on.

00:21:22.709 --> 00:21:27.250
Those who get bitten
go on to bite others.

00:21:39.952 --> 00:21:41.120
People are...

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.999
...like this cube.

00:21:45.636 --> 00:21:48.331
Most of the time,
we only see one side.

00:21:48.488 --> 00:21:51.999
But everyone has other sides too.

00:21:52.574 --> 00:21:57.632
Just because they have a dark side
doesn't mean they're not them, right?

00:21:57.999 --> 00:22:01.167
What if you erase that darkness?

00:22:01.294 --> 00:22:03.593
That means they're
not the same, right?

00:22:04.413 --> 00:22:06.077
So, all sides are authentic?

00:22:06.862 --> 00:22:10.495
That's how I see it.
People have different sides.

00:22:11.916 --> 00:22:14.459
Mom, I had the cube solved!

00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:16.542
Just solve it again.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.538
What about you?

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.037
Do you have a dark side too?

00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:32.166
Huh?

00:22:33.547 --> 00:22:35.196
The man the police are after...

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:41.521
James is the bad guy,
and not you, right?

00:22:55.918 --> 00:23:00.626
Once a craving is filled,
people can never go back.

00:23:00.738 --> 00:23:03.831
I used to raise a dog.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.250
The poor thing couldn't fit in anywhere,
so I took care of it.

00:23:08.292 --> 00:23:10.626
I fed it and gave it attention.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.375
I used to raise a dog.

00:23:15.417 --> 00:23:17.459
The poor thing couldn't fit in...

00:23:17.999 --> 00:23:20.167
I used to raise a dog.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.461
The poor thing couldn't fit in anywhere,
so I took care of it.

00:23:47.791 --> 00:23:49.667
Making someone yours is easy.

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:53.236
Find their weakness
and stoke their desires.

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:03.626
PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:24:06.328 --> 00:24:10.203
STRUGGLING WITH HER
HUSBAND'S CANCER TREATMENT BILLS

00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:13.876
A thief that can be forgiven, or not.

00:25:14.334 --> 00:25:15.500
Which one are you?

00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:18.999
James is the bad guy,
and not you, right?

00:25:20.999 --> 00:25:22.459
NEW MESSAGE

00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:33.876
DK

00:25:33.918 --> 00:25:36.292
HELLO, I'M A NOOBIE.
HOW CAN I BUY?

00:25:40.743 --> 00:25:42.367
Not much more to go.

00:25:45.683 --> 00:25:46.999
Just until two hundred million.

00:25:49.584 --> 00:25:52.667
Yes, then I'll quit.

00:26:03.643 --> 00:26:06.128
Transfer the payment
to the account below,

00:26:06.584 --> 00:26:10.542
and we'll ship it
to the address you want.

00:26:10.584 --> 00:26:12.626
HIGH-RISK ANTICANCER DRUG
BAEK DOJIN

00:26:32.649 --> 00:26:36.571
Don't be shocked by that.
I recommend you shave your head.

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:40.542
No matter how expensive,
it won't stop your hair loss.

00:26:42.945 --> 00:26:45.726
Not so expensive with insurance, right?

00:26:45.828 --> 00:26:49.042
You're new to this, huh?
Didn't you know?

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:51.167
Insurance doesn't cover it.

00:27:02.936 --> 00:27:03.896
Hey...

00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:07.692
For me?

00:27:11.827 --> 00:27:14.445
I... got the job.

00:27:17.063 --> 00:27:21.425
You passed? Really?
That's amazing!

00:27:21.597 --> 00:27:23.209
Congratulations!

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.807
Cheers!

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.324
Oh, wow!

00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:33.234
Thank you... so much.

00:27:33.273 --> 00:27:35.273
It's not like I did anything.

00:27:36.851 --> 00:27:39.148
Your parents must be so proud.

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:50.876
You know what?

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:56.167
They say the hardest thing
is living diligently.

00:27:57.459 --> 00:27:59.876
You pulled it off, Donghyun.

00:28:01.835 --> 00:28:04.915
Your little brother's lucky
to have someone like you.

00:28:08.043 --> 00:28:14.792
I just wanted... to live, you know?

00:28:57.755 --> 00:29:00.999
Are we still in contact
with that money-grubber?

00:29:01.542 --> 00:29:02.709
Oh, right.

00:29:19.792 --> 00:29:23.918
Get him to figure out
who they are and how many.

00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:45.417
Why so serious?

00:29:45.795 --> 00:29:48.542
What?
Loan interest rates?

00:29:48.712 --> 00:29:50.999
No, it's nothing.

00:29:54.892 --> 00:29:55.892
What about Kang Eunsoo?

00:29:56.865 --> 00:29:59.333
I checked with her husband's
family and friends.

00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:00.999
She really did borrow money.

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.999
And the scarf is a common one too.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:05.942
Yeah?

00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:09.492
What about her alibi?

00:30:10.951 --> 00:30:12.453
Here's the SD card.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.961
Her neighbor's dashcam showed
her entering the house.

00:30:18.211 --> 00:30:19.891
But no footage of her leaving.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.334
It's a redevelopment zone,
so there were no surveillance cameras.

00:30:34.021 --> 00:30:34.979
Watching porn?

00:30:37.959 --> 00:30:41.482
Look. Doesn't this look like her?

00:30:41.584 --> 00:30:44.042
She's all covered up here.
It's hard to tell.

00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:51.480
My gut says yes,
but there's no concrete proof.

00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:54.709
Why are you even here, anyway?

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.398
I canceled my leave.

00:30:59.326 --> 00:31:02.744
What's up?
I thought you had nothing special.

00:31:03.584 --> 00:31:07.042
Trespassing cases.
Three times in the same neighborhood.

00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:12.000
Witness statements and descriptions
all point to the same guy.

00:31:12.964 --> 00:31:13.999
But it's strange.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.500
Nothing was stolen
and nobody was hurt.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Weird.

00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:23.375
Exactly. It's illegal trespassing,
so we have to investigate.

00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:25.700
But there's no damage,
no clues, nothing.

00:31:26.912 --> 00:31:30.626
It's frustrating.
I can't figure out the motive.

00:31:32.305 --> 00:31:33.439
Maybe he's searching...

00:31:34.194 --> 00:31:35.181
What?

00:31:42.797 --> 00:31:43.751
What's going on?

00:31:43.792 --> 00:31:47.258
Kang Eunsoo, you're under arrest
for drug trafficking.

00:31:48.042 --> 00:31:51.999
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

00:31:51.999 --> 00:31:53.834
Anything you say may be
used against you in court.

00:31:53.876 --> 00:31:54.999
Let's go.

00:31:58.591 --> 00:31:59.628
- Wait!
- Eunsoo!

00:31:59.709 --> 00:32:02.042
How could you?
Are you insane?

00:32:02.083 --> 00:32:06.584
- She sold drugs.
- How could a mom sell drugs?

00:32:07.577 --> 00:32:08.999
Oh my god...

00:32:08.999 --> 00:32:09.999
Sua...

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:11.417
You were the bad person.

00:32:11.959 --> 00:32:15.250
Sua, let me explain.
It's not like that.

00:32:15.448 --> 00:32:18.209
Sua! Sua! Sua!

00:32:28.108 --> 00:32:29.545
Mrs. Kang.

00:32:29.751 --> 00:32:30.999
Mrs. Kang!

00:32:31.999 --> 00:32:33.500
Kang Eunsoo!

00:32:36.834 --> 00:32:38.999
How unlike you,
dozing off in front of money.

00:32:43.959 --> 00:32:45.209
Did something happen?

00:32:53.209 --> 00:32:57.242
Our job is all about caution,
from start to finish.

00:32:57.265 --> 00:32:58.999
Selling is different from using.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.061
If you're caught,
it's straight to prison.

00:33:01.334 --> 00:33:04.167
Don't hide anything,
or stab me in the back.

00:33:04.209 --> 00:33:05.626
I won't let you slide twice.

00:33:05.667 --> 00:33:06.626
I understand.

00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:15.751
I guess I should tell him.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.353
Actually...

00:33:18.377 --> 00:33:19.999
You wear size 240, right?

00:33:21.626 --> 00:33:22.834
I got these for you.

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:25.857
Go on, open it.

00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:46.968
You lost your sneakers that day.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.780
They looked worn out
to be used anyway.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.100
I just wore it cuz it was comfy.

00:33:54.125 --> 00:33:58.167
I have nowhere to wear this to.
You should've cashed me instead.

00:33:58.393 --> 00:34:01.291
Gosh. You and your love for money...

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.393
Then don't wear them.
Just keep them.

00:34:03.424 --> 00:34:05.416
It'll give you confidence
knowing you have them.

00:34:05.573 --> 00:34:10.042
The rich and the poor's
perception of money is different.

00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:12.834
The poor only think of chasing money.

00:34:12.876 --> 00:34:16.131
But the rich think of how to use it.

00:34:17.042 --> 00:34:18.999
I think too, okay?

00:34:18.999 --> 00:34:23.048
My husband's hospital bills, the loans,
Sua's tuition, academy fees...

00:34:23.068 --> 00:34:24.152
What about you?

00:34:25.753 --> 00:34:29.295
Don't you want anything
for yourself?

00:34:29.375 --> 00:34:32.999
It won't take long
until we hit your target.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.918
You'll soon hand over
the leftover pills and be done.

00:34:37.763 --> 00:34:40.177
Back to minimum wage,
two or three jobs,

00:34:40.202 --> 00:34:44.079
nursing your husband, sending
your kid to school. Can you do that?

00:34:45.999 --> 00:34:48.125
But I can't keep doing this forever.

00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:49.999
- Why not?
- Because it's wrong.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.335
Who in the world gets rich
just by doing good?

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:59.000
You're wasting your talent.

00:34:59.042 --> 00:35:01.210
I think you can really shine
in this field.

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:04.999
Think about it.
What do you really want?

00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:13.877
CONGRATULATIONS!
HERE'S A BIRTHDAY COUPON!

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:22.162
Heading to the hospital?
Get up, I'll take you.

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:01.876
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

00:37:01.918 --> 00:37:02.999
ACADEMIC AWARD

00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:23.500
You really want to eat at this hour?
It'll all go to fat.

00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:26.451
She's hungry after cram school.

00:37:26.975 --> 00:37:28.975
You're not the only one.

00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:32.542
- Lady, make me a decaf coffee.
- Sure.

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:36.999
CRIMINAL LAW LECTURE

00:37:39.709 --> 00:37:41.999
EXCELLENCE AWARD
YOON JINHEE

00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:46.791
The grand prize went to Sua, right?

00:37:57.935 --> 00:38:01.568
Isn't she one of the top students?

00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:05.642
Not the top.
She barely made the top 20.

00:38:05.673 --> 00:38:08.462
That's pretty good
for someone doing art.

00:38:08.709 --> 00:38:11.235
How come she's good
at everything?

00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:14.292
She even started drawing
later than you.

00:38:16.106 --> 00:38:18.542
If she had rich parents,
she'd have been unstoppable.

00:38:19.614 --> 00:38:21.934
Didn't I tell you to go
to an art academy?

00:38:21.965 --> 00:38:24.731
After-school lessons
can't beat academy education.

00:38:24.809 --> 00:38:26.999
- Switch now, and...
- No!

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.584
Oh, what I meant is...

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:40.933
The art teacher is better
than the academy teachers.

00:38:41.386 --> 00:38:44.209
Sua beat the academy students
and is entering the city contest.

00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:47.906
What? Where?

00:38:49.999 --> 00:38:50.999
The city art contest?

00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:54.083
Yeah!
The art tutor recommended me.

00:38:54.226 --> 00:38:55.542
And my HR teacher is into art.

00:38:57.334 --> 00:39:00.733
I wish he were our
real school teacher.

00:39:01.479 --> 00:39:06.959
He even graduated top of his art college.
I've never met anyone like that.

00:39:07.209 --> 00:39:08.573
- Like what?
- You know...

00:39:08.604 --> 00:39:13.834
He's just perfect.
Flawless. He's amazing.

00:39:17.162 --> 00:39:21.334
Sua, are you sure
you won't go to an art academy?

00:39:21.498 --> 00:39:23.709
I got a bonus payment.

00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:27.626
If you want to go to arts high,
prep starts this winter break.

00:39:29.006 --> 00:39:30.183
My answer's still a no.

00:39:30.999 --> 00:39:32.918
Do you know how much
the tuition is?

00:39:33.334 --> 00:39:34.999
It's ten million won a year.

00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:39.865
You won't go?
Or you can't go?

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.999
I really wish you would act your age.

00:39:43.999 --> 00:39:48.477
A girl who only thinks of herself,
and not money or parents.

00:39:49.209 --> 00:39:52.417
C'mon, who gets to live
how they want?

00:39:52.579 --> 00:39:55.270
- Definitely not you, Mom.
- Sua...

00:39:59.999 --> 00:40:01.981
- What's that vibration?
- Huh?

00:40:02.075 --> 00:40:04.918
Your phone's here,
but there's another vibration.

00:40:06.367 --> 00:40:08.242
Weird. Isn't it yours?

00:40:08.721 --> 00:40:10.928
My phone's not on vibrate mode.

00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:28.125
Hello, ma'am.

00:40:28.417 --> 00:40:30.189
I'm from High River City.

00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:33.751
Come by and see
our new model home.

00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:36.822
We're giving away
a microwave by raffle.

00:40:36.845 --> 00:40:38.877
Thank you, but we're okay.

00:40:38.892 --> 00:40:41.773
Mom, they have giveaways.
Let's go look.

00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:49.437
The living room is a four-bay layout with
cross-ventilation and an extended balcony.

00:40:49.453 --> 00:40:51.167
Wow, it's really nice!

00:40:51.209 --> 00:40:53.417
- Can I sit here?
- Of course.

00:40:53.459 --> 00:40:54.459
Thank you.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:59.925
The master bedroom was designed
to look like a resort,

00:40:59.941 --> 00:41:03.375
with en-suite bath, powder room,
and walk-in closet.

00:41:04.459 --> 00:41:08.000
If you'll step out to the kitchen,

00:41:08.042 --> 00:41:11.292
it's separated with sliding doors,

00:41:11.334 --> 00:41:14.000
and fits a double-door fridge
and a kimchi fridge...

00:41:14.042 --> 00:41:17.918
Mom, this place is amazing.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.083
It's a solid 115.7㎡ unit.
Very well made.

00:41:24.626 --> 00:41:27.042
The price is at 1.28 billion won.

00:41:28.459 --> 00:41:30.670
That might be out of our range.

00:41:31.147 --> 00:41:33.440
Mom, this is so comfortable.

00:41:54.474 --> 00:41:56.669
Mom, I'm hungry.
When's dinner?

00:41:56.927 --> 00:41:58.911
Soon.
Dad will be home soon.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.999
Sua, I'm home!

00:42:07.889 --> 00:42:09.432
Welcome back.

00:42:09.696 --> 00:42:11.667
What's this? Bungeoppang?

00:42:12.209 --> 00:42:15.167
You said you were craving them
a few days ago.

00:42:15.876 --> 00:42:17.876
Wow, what's all this?

00:42:17.918 --> 00:42:18.999
Welcome home.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.375
You made all this yourself?

00:42:21.417 --> 00:42:23.999
Yes, because it's a special day.

00:42:25.637 --> 00:42:27.999
- Pour me as well.
- Sure.

00:42:28.751 --> 00:42:30.542
Sua, I'm a lucky man, right?

00:42:30.584 --> 00:42:31.999
Yes, yes.

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:35.042
You should find a man
like your mom, okay?

00:42:35.281 --> 00:42:37.626
That didn't sound right.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.500
Thank you very much.

00:42:41.042 --> 00:42:41.834
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:42:41.876 --> 00:42:44.999
- To our beautiful night!
- Cheers!

00:42:47.527 --> 00:42:49.209
Mmm, delicious.

00:42:49.918 --> 00:42:51.918
- Thank you for the meal.
- Enjoy.

00:42:51.959 --> 00:42:53.751
Let's dig in!

00:42:53.792 --> 00:42:55.083
It's really good!

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:58.523
- I heard you got a boyfriend.
- No.

00:42:58.562 --> 00:42:59.834
Ma'am?

00:42:59.876 --> 00:43:01.250
Uh, ma'am?

00:43:03.999 --> 00:43:06.999
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

00:43:08.584 --> 00:43:12.870
How much loan
can we take for this house?

00:43:12.925 --> 00:43:14.042
The police called you?

00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:18.125
Yeah. They didn't say why,
and just asked

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.334
if I'd lent Eunsoo money.

00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:24.446
When I said yes,
they just hung up.

00:43:24.798 --> 00:43:29.834
I was worried, so I asked Eunsoo
the other day when we met.

00:43:29.876 --> 00:43:33.959
She said it was a misunderstanding
and wouldn't give details.

00:43:34.825 --> 00:43:37.896
I hope it's nothing serious.

00:43:41.182 --> 00:43:43.583
Sorry, it's a habit.

00:43:47.422 --> 00:43:50.209
- Yeoju.
- Yes?

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.918
You said Eunsoo
borrowed money all over, right?

00:43:53.946 --> 00:43:55.999
Any idea about how much in total?

00:43:59.975 --> 00:44:01.402
Everyone, take your seats.

00:44:07.959 --> 00:44:11.682
Not to alarm you, but something
unpleasant happened today.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.542
Someone lost their money.
Does anyone know anything?

00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:22.389
If you speak up now,
there'll be no disciplinary action.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.792
Come see me privately
if you know something.

00:44:25.834 --> 00:44:27.626
- Okay?
- Yes, miss.

00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:28.999
End of homeroom.

00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:14.491
Let's start with Hyeseon's piece.

00:45:15.732 --> 00:45:19.771
Hyeseon relies on lines
more than planes.

00:45:19.841 --> 00:45:23.083
That can flatten the form
and kill the depth.

00:45:23.125 --> 00:45:25.576
Rather than tracing with lines,

00:45:25.615 --> 00:45:28.834
use planes to portray it
more naturally.

00:45:29.467 --> 00:45:32.459
Next, Jinhee.

00:45:33.533 --> 00:45:37.915
I love that your white highlights
aren't overdone.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:38.999
Well done.

00:45:39.626 --> 00:45:44.167
But overall,
the sense of distance is weak.

00:45:44.258 --> 00:45:45.999
Let's look at Sua's work.

00:45:46.959 --> 00:45:51.213
Like Sua, think carefully about
the space between objects,

00:45:51.237 --> 00:45:53.792
and vary how you render them.

00:45:53.834 --> 00:45:56.999
See? The space breathes better, right?

00:45:56.999 --> 00:45:58.283
Yes.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.999
Good job, everyone.
Well done.

00:46:01.576 --> 00:46:04.826
That's it for today.
Any questions?

00:46:05.999 --> 00:46:08.396
When do you start prep
for the arts high entrance?

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.375
Will you be teaching it yourself?

00:46:10.417 --> 00:46:13.959
Yes, over the winter break.
Only for those who sign up.

00:46:14.775 --> 00:46:19.042
Hi. Our school is under the same
foundation as Seo-jung Arts High.

00:46:19.236 --> 00:46:21.978
Does that give us an advantage?

00:46:23.334 --> 00:46:26.959
That's hard for me to answer.

00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:29.167
Yes, Jinhee's mother.

00:46:29.209 --> 00:46:33.334
I heard canvases and supplies
have gone missing in the art club.

00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:37.000
How are you handling it?
Have you found the culprit?

00:46:39.016 --> 00:46:41.999
Ma'am, could we discuss
that privately later?

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.167
I heard there was a theft
in your class today, too.

00:46:46.209 --> 00:46:51.250
If these are recent events, isn't it
likely that it was the same culprit?

00:46:51.402 --> 00:46:56.676
There's a correlation.
Students in your class who take art.

00:46:56.999 --> 00:46:57.999
Who?

00:46:58.709 --> 00:47:01.667
Class 5, right?
Who's in 5?

00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:03.542
Who could it be?

00:47:03.584 --> 00:47:05.042
It's Class 5.

00:47:05.626 --> 00:47:06.999
Class 5?

00:47:07.417 --> 00:47:10.769
Wait a minute.
What are you implying?

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.709
I'm not shielding my daughter,

00:47:12.933 --> 00:47:16.073
but Jinhee has no reason
to steal money.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.959
Same for Yoojung,
who lives in our building.

00:47:19.167 --> 00:47:23.014
Sadly, we're left with one student.

00:47:24.292 --> 00:47:25.542
What?

00:47:41.667 --> 00:47:44.999
There've been rumors among the girls.

00:47:44.999 --> 00:47:48.005
I want you to be honest with me.

00:47:57.876 --> 00:47:58.999
Sua?

00:48:10.404 --> 00:48:12.237
I didn't steal anything.

00:48:14.167 --> 00:48:16.999
I checked Sua's bag and locker myself.

00:48:16.999 --> 00:48:18.500
There was nothing.

00:48:18.542 --> 00:48:21.500
Not finding it
doesn't prove her innocence.

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:26.250
Let's call the school officer
and settle it properly.

00:48:26.999 --> 00:48:28.751
Didn't you hear her?

00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:31.472
She said she didn't do it.
There's no proof!

00:48:31.584 --> 00:48:33.999
Why is a law professor
picking on a child?

00:48:33.999 --> 00:48:36.959
Age won't undo a theft.

00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:40.491
It's always the guilty
that demand 'proof'.

00:48:40.515 --> 00:48:43.265
Circumstantial proof counts too.

00:48:45.751 --> 00:48:48.626
We all know your situation.

00:48:48.683 --> 00:48:53.404
Does it make sense for Sua
to carry something that expensive?

00:48:53.404 --> 00:48:56.626
I bought them myself.
Want the receipts?

00:48:58.125 --> 00:49:03.375
That makes even less sense.
Where'd you get the money?

00:49:03.417 --> 00:49:05.999
It's a reasonable suspicion.

00:49:05.999 --> 00:49:08.766
Stop whining and answer properly.

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:12.079
If it adds up, I'll apologize.

00:49:13.529 --> 00:49:16.944
Now that you mention it,
that thing is pricey.

00:49:22.832 --> 00:49:25.459
Are you saying the poor
aren't allowed to buy stuff?

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.125
I scrimp so I can give my child
something nice.

00:49:28.167 --> 00:49:30.844
Do I need your permission for that?

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:33.054
Who do you think you are?

00:49:42.417 --> 00:49:44.459
Fine, then...

00:49:46.417 --> 00:49:47.999
What about this?

00:49:48.838 --> 00:49:54.250
Two weeks ago.
Monday, November 1st, 11 pm.

00:49:56.096 --> 00:49:59.595
What did you do with the art tutor?

00:50:00.415 --> 00:50:02.834
I saw you getting out of his car.

00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:05.500
Is that true?

00:50:06.619 --> 00:50:13.709
What business does a parent have
with an after-school tutor at that hour?

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.584
Is that how Sua
got into the city contest?

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:24.999
A special favor
from a special friend?

00:50:27.665 --> 00:50:31.792
Come on.
She has a husband.

00:51:15.125 --> 00:51:16.453
- Actually...
- I'm his housekeeper.

00:51:18.626 --> 00:51:19.751
What?

00:51:21.406 --> 00:51:22.364
What did you say?

00:51:23.794 --> 00:51:25.794
I'm the art tutor's housekeeper.

00:51:38.667 --> 00:51:41.999
I've been doing it
before Sua joined this class.

00:51:42.042 --> 00:51:45.626
When I realized that
he was Sua's tutor, I tried to quit.

00:51:45.898 --> 00:51:48.999
But as you all know,
my husband was hospitalized.

00:51:49.876 --> 00:51:51.125
Is that true?

00:51:57.132 --> 00:51:58.132
Yes.

00:51:59.459 --> 00:52:02.795
I knew her situation.
I couldn't just replace her.

00:52:02.889 --> 00:52:04.224
And I couldn't tell the school.

00:52:04.647 --> 00:52:09.481
Still, why would you give her
a ride at that hour?

00:52:09.512 --> 00:52:13.834
She bumped her car
outside my house.

00:52:14.417 --> 00:52:16.999
She called insurance
and gave them her car.

00:52:16.999 --> 00:52:19.999
So I offered her a ride
on my way out.

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:23.751
I'm sorry if I caused trouble.

00:52:31.209 --> 00:52:36.083
Also, isn't Sua's drawing too good
to be given special favors?

00:52:36.125 --> 00:52:38.292
- True!
- That's a good point!

00:52:38.334 --> 00:52:41.292
- Can't deny that.
- Right.

00:52:43.697 --> 00:52:47.502
I think it was a big misunderstanding.
So let's wrap up...

00:52:47.517 --> 00:52:49.667
We'll wrap up after the apology.

00:52:50.999 --> 00:52:53.751
Apologize.
To both me and Sua.

00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:03.200
You spread filthy rumors,
and you won't apologize for it?

00:53:03.224 --> 00:53:08.798
From my point of view,
the circumstances justified suspicion.

00:53:08.845 --> 00:53:12.993
You're the one responsible for creating
such suspicion in the first place.

00:53:13.999 --> 00:53:17.792
And the thief hasn't been caught yet.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.999
Unbelievable,
right to the bitter end.

00:53:20.999 --> 00:53:25.000
We'll be going.
Come on, Jinhee.

00:53:25.999 --> 00:53:27.459
Ma'am.

00:53:37.792 --> 00:53:39.584
Please calm down.

00:53:39.999 --> 00:53:42.125
You shouldn't leave like this
for Jinhee's sake.

00:53:43.751 --> 00:53:46.292
Could we talk one-on-one?

00:54:24.762 --> 00:54:27.334
- Ta-da!
- Wow, samgyetang!

00:54:27.999 --> 00:54:30.871
- Did that lady give us this too?
- Yeah.

00:54:31.223 --> 00:54:32.999
- And the side dishes?
- Yup.

00:54:32.999 --> 00:54:33.999
Let's eat.

00:54:38.417 --> 00:54:40.209
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

00:54:46.084 --> 00:54:47.877
Wow, this is incredible!

00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:50.946
That lady must really like you.

00:54:58.471 --> 00:55:00.929
MONEY-GRUBBER: 32-GIL HAENGBOK-RO.
INSIDE THE BEDROOM'S BLANKET

00:55:05.171 --> 00:55:06.296
What's wrong?

00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:24.999
Huh?

00:55:25.999 --> 00:55:27.292
2021 MIDDLE SCHOOL ART CONTEST IN SEOUL

00:55:35.125 --> 00:55:36.459
THE SHAPE OF A PERSON
BY PARK SUA

00:55:40.876 --> 00:55:43.042
GRAND PRIZE - PARK SUA

00:55:43.254 --> 00:55:45.358
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:55:50.083 --> 00:55:51.083
Delicious!

00:55:53.125 --> 00:55:55.125
No doubt you're mother and daughter.

00:55:55.167 --> 00:55:57.893
You're celebrating
like it's actually alcohol.

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:06.792
But what if someone sees us?
Won't it start another rumor?

00:56:07.999 --> 00:56:09.802
I asked Mom to come.

00:56:09.881 --> 00:56:10.881
Oh, really?

00:56:15.999 --> 00:56:16.999
Mr. Lee!

00:56:22.454 --> 00:56:26.250
Thanks for helping last time
and for recommending me.

00:56:26.292 --> 00:56:27.167
It's all thanks to you.

00:56:27.712 --> 00:56:29.209
- Can I open it?
- Sure.

00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:56.876
Mr. Lee?

00:56:57.798 --> 00:57:00.717
Yeah.
You caught me off guard.

00:57:02.659 --> 00:57:06.284
I love it. Really, I do.

00:57:10.555 --> 00:57:11.928
You're handsome.

00:57:13.101 --> 00:57:16.312
Hey! What are you saying?

00:57:16.398 --> 00:57:19.999
I'm just saying he's handsome
because he is.

00:57:21.646 --> 00:57:23.927
That trait is not mine at all.

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.999
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's your Dad's!

00:57:26.999 --> 00:57:28.083
No way!

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.167
Cheers.

00:57:54.542 --> 00:57:55.667
What's wrong?

00:57:56.792 --> 00:57:58.834
I need the restroom.

00:58:04.417 --> 00:58:06.959
- We should come here often.
- Yes, why not?

00:58:08.459 --> 00:58:09.626
Eat, go on.

00:58:23.289 --> 00:58:24.553
You're a gigolo now?

00:58:25.638 --> 00:58:27.053
You sure looked like one.

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:32.792
I said I wasn't curious,
but the way you earn money is disgusting.

00:58:37.834 --> 00:58:39.167
I feel tainted.

00:58:44.127 --> 00:58:47.083
How much longer, huh?
Until when?

00:58:47.334 --> 00:58:50.500
It's been ten years.
How do you think I've been?

00:58:50.542 --> 00:58:53.083
I've been killing myself
to make up for what happened!

00:58:59.143 --> 00:59:00.707
You think you can undo it?

00:59:02.264 --> 00:59:03.264
The shit you did?

00:59:17.834 --> 00:59:21.459
If you have any conscience,
do your part right.

00:59:21.735 --> 00:59:24.858
Our family comes here often.

00:59:42.334 --> 00:59:44.709
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

00:59:48.139 --> 00:59:49.067
Where's Sua?

00:59:49.373 --> 00:59:52.247
She went to meet a friend earlier.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.918
What you said was right.

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:07.999
Just coming here
lifted my confidence.

01:00:10.167 --> 01:00:12.999
Here, a gift for you.

01:00:15.631 --> 01:00:19.042
You already have everything,
so I didn't know what to give.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:21.751
But I saw your strap was worn out.

01:00:25.094 --> 01:00:26.093
Don't you like it?

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.417
I'll get going then.

01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:32.125
Want a drink?

01:00:36.626 --> 01:00:37.888
Just one drink.

01:00:53.285 --> 01:00:54.584
Welcome.

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:56.542
Oh, hello.

01:00:56.999 --> 01:00:59.375
Please, sit here.

01:01:08.445 --> 01:01:12.125
Being near the hospital,
many people come to shave their heads.

01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:14.709
Things must be hard.

01:01:14.785 --> 01:01:18.706
They say I'm getting better.
I might even go home soon.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.792
That's wonderful.
You must be homesick.

01:01:22.834 --> 01:01:24.751
Yes, very much.

01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:29.459
Won't your family be shocked
to see you bald?

01:01:30.209 --> 01:01:34.999
You should come again
after you recover.

01:02:19.697 --> 01:02:20.823
Are you okay?

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:23.250
Of course.

01:02:37.365 --> 01:02:38.837
Can you get off by yourself?

01:03:09.662 --> 01:03:10.662
Mrs. Kang!

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:20.209
Seriously?
After a single can of beer?

01:03:25.061 --> 01:03:26.271
Mrs. Kang!

01:03:31.335 --> 01:03:32.334
Get up.

01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:33.999
Get up.

01:03:34.751 --> 01:03:35.876
Lean on me.

01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.209
Wait.

01:04:11.391 --> 01:04:14.999
Sua will be home soon.
Pull yourself together.

01:04:19.811 --> 01:04:20.999
Thank you.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.959
For not leaving you on the streets?

01:04:25.292 --> 01:04:30.375
Not that.
That too, but...

01:04:31.247 --> 01:04:34.999
I mean, at the open class.

01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:38.709
Thanks for siding with me.

01:04:41.083 --> 01:04:44.918
Forget about it.
That professor lady was annoying.

01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:46.999
Such a smug.

01:04:47.209 --> 01:04:49.959
She called multiple times to recheck.

01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:53.709
That makes two of us.

01:04:55.918 --> 01:04:57.535
Yang Miyeon is a bitch.

01:04:57.999 --> 01:05:02.999
I've always wanted to
say it out loud.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.468
I see. You become honest
when you get drunk.

01:05:10.477 --> 01:05:15.893
By the way, earlier today...

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:19.292
Who were the three people
seated by the window?

01:05:23.209 --> 01:05:24.584
You don't have to answer.

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:36.046
My family.

01:05:37.219 --> 01:05:38.720
The people who used to be
my family.

01:05:41.417 --> 01:05:42.918
Today's actually my birthday.

01:05:44.209 --> 01:05:45.250
Really?

01:05:47.514 --> 01:05:49.138
Happy birthday.

01:05:51.876 --> 01:05:54.459
Thanks. I haven't heard that
in ten years.

01:05:57.071 --> 01:05:59.417
- Strange.
- What?

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:05.167
You're not usually this open.
But today, you seem different.

01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:12.167
You should open up as well.

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.736
What do you really want?

01:06:22.167 --> 01:06:26.895
That makes even less sense.
Where'd you get the money?

01:06:29.234 --> 01:06:30.261
All of them.

01:06:33.745 --> 01:06:34.981
I want to kill them all.

01:06:37.999 --> 01:06:41.834
Anyone who harms
my daughter or my family.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.334
And everyone who looks down on me.

01:06:45.999 --> 01:06:51.792
I don't want anyone
to ever dare hurt me again.

01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:04.661
Really?

01:07:06.366 --> 01:07:07.408
Then...

01:07:09.209 --> 01:07:10.709
How about we keep going?

01:08:23.083 --> 01:08:25.751
WALKING ON THIN ICE

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.709
Boss, what should I do with the thief?

01:08:29.999 --> 01:08:31.125
Kill 'em.

01:08:33.999 --> 01:08:35.500
Get treatment first.

01:08:35.626 --> 01:08:39.219
We're in a life-or-death situation.
Fuck the wound, okay?

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.999
- And Kang Eunsoo?
- Eunsoo? There she is.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.918
You know Hwang Donghyun too?

01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:45.999
Then what about Phantom?

01:08:47.613 --> 01:08:49.292
We've located Hwang Donghyun's phone!

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.375
Isn't this an opportunity for us?

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:53.500
We can pin this on Phantom more easily.

01:08:54.999 --> 01:08:56.584
Just like you said.
