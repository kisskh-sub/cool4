[Echoes of the Self]

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.480
Zhou Kui.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.060
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.410
He planted explosives
around the Imperial City.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.200
Fu Wei.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.239
Should I address you
as the Minister of Rites

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.270
or the Fifth Prince of Daqing?

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.730
How unexpected.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.620
I have

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.140
hidden my identity for so many years,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.430
yet

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.350
I was exposed by a mere girl.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.710
Is this the real reason
you killed Madam Wang?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.470
Wang saw the tattoo on my hand.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.980
She had to die.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.440
But come to think of it,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.650
if anyone's to blame,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.330
it's you, Princess of Daqing,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.500
for your sudden arrival.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.360
She thought

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.920
she had found a protector

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.070
and dared to leave my mansion.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.640
Your Highness,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.430
you've been deceiving me for a long time.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.680
This time,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.840
you can hand over
the Red-armored Army's command token,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.600
no,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.280
the real command token,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.490
to me now.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.390
The Red-armored Army

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.889
is Yunrui's elite force.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.140
I will never give it to you.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.710
Look.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.079
With just one command from me,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.900
the entire Imperial City
will be reduced to ashes.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.090
Think carefully.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.520
This is your last chance.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.870
Will you surrender it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.310
or not?

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.780
Father.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.640
The command token.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.270
May you,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680
Father, reign for thousands of years

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.280

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.210
Die today.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.060
Xi!

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.650
You killed my mother.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.700
I will kill you

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.430
to avenge her.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.570
The rebel leader is eliminated.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.020
Surrender now.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.270
I can

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.880
still spare your lives.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.420
We surrender

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.410
and beg Your Majesty for mercy.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.200
Ruoyao.

Father,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.490
you must be startled.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.530
This place is dangerous.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.050
I will

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.930
escort you back to the palace now.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.020
hidden my identity for so many years,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.440
but never expected

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.740
to be outsmarted by all of you.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.850
Zhou Kui,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.400
everything you've done

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.160
is your own doing.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.350
The one who took your throne

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.540
wasn't Yunrui.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.920
Those who made you homeless

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.730
weren't the people of Qingzhou either.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.990
None of this had anything to do with them.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.720
What does...

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.940
What does that have to do with you?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.120
You were just a substitute.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.640
You're not Princess Fu Wei at all.

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.920
Of course I'm not the Princess of Daqing.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.720
I am Zhou Ruoxi.

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:49.740
What did you say?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.840
I am Zhou Ruoxi
from 3 years in the future.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.159
I am your daughter.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.750
Father.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.500
In this reincarnated life,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.430
I thought saving my mother

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.930
would change everything.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.990
But what I never expected was

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.600
that the one behind all this

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.600
was actually you.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.960
Fine.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.520
Fine.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.360
Since it has come to this,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
I will...

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.230
I will make everyone in the city

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.159
die with me.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.659
Shoot!

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.510
How can this be?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.240
Why hasn't the Imperial City exploded?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.330
How is this possible?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.000
I already had

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.860

Search carefully around the Imperial City.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.450
If you find any gunpowder,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.620
destroy it at once.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.560
Yes.

Destroyed?

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.830
My grand legacy.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.520
I've hidden my true identity

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.400
and endured all my life.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.300
All destroyed by you.

All ruined by you.

I trust you.

I always have.

The one you should trust

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.850
is yourself.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.420
That day in the Crown Prince's Mansion,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.900
I discovered Zhou Kui

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.660
had stockpiled
large amounts of sulfur and charcoal.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.590
I knew things weren't that simple.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.920
So

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.870
I had to pretend to go along with him

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.240
and use the situation to my advantage.

Yes.

I'll take you all with me.

since you called me that.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.910

I remember our two lifetimes.

We've always stood
by each other through life and death.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.450
So our first meeting

was actually a reunion.

why can't we escape our fate,

nor this snow?

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.610
No need to escape.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.620
And don't be afraid.
