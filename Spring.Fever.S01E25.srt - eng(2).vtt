00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.392
(Duting Station)

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.040
Shen Que.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.640
Shen Que!

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.040
Is Lord Shen at home?

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.040
He moved away long ago.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.440
He's no longer at Duting Station.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.240
Where did he go?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.920
I dare not ask

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.160
where he went.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.280
Shen Que.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.120
Shen Que! Shen Que! Shen Que!

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.680
Shen Que!

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.240
Shen Que!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.920
Can you hear me?

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
Shen Que!

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:06.720

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.720
Lady Ye came to seek medicine
for Lu Shi'an.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
Should I go there?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.040
No need.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.040
You were looking for me, Lady Ye?

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.680
Lord Gao.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.600
Why is Shen Que avoiding me?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.160
These past few days,
he has been in a bad mood.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520
Bad mood?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.320
Yes.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.360
Why is he in a bad mood?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.960
What happened?

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280
We've found the person
who poisoned Princess Anhe.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.320
Who?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.760
Speak!

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.560
It was Postmaster Sang, your father.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.400
Wh-Where is Shen Que?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.440
He won't see you.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.400
Tell me where he is!

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.440
Duchun House.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.840
Lady Ye.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.160
Lady Ye.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.560
Farewell, my lord.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.040
Do visit again, my lord.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.360
Come have fun next time.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.040
Young lady.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.560
You're annoying.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.680
Lady,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.680
Duchun House is reserved
by a lord today.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.880
You may not enter.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.280
Step aside.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.080
A woman coming to a place like this...

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.080
Are you looking to sell yourself?

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.928
How much should I pay to get in?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.680
Is this enough?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.280
This isn't nearly enough.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.760
Take off your clothes.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.760
Take them off.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.880
- Take them off.
- Take them off.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.200
Shen Que!

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.120
I know you're inside.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.760
I didn't break our promise.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.040
I waited for you in the back alley.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.240
I waited for hours and you never came.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.800
Lu Shi'an drank the poison

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.440
Madam Lu prepared for me.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.400
His life hangs by a thread now.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.240
I can't let him die in my place.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.160
I really want to leave with you.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.240
But I don't want to owe him any debts.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.480
My heart belongs only
to you and Jin now.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480
Shen Que!

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720
The lord says to let the lady enter.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.560
Please.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.200
- Go in.
- Go in.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.680
(Who delivered the last meal)

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.440
(served to Princess Anhe?)

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200
It was the postmaster.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.720
Before she died, Postmaster Sang Huai

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.840
(did purchase curare plants.)

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.800
(Master Fei's bone analysis
confirms this.)

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.280
(That postmaster colluded
with the Lu family,)

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.560
(harboring pirates
and sustaining bandits.)

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.880
(When Princess Anhe learned this,)

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.000
(she couldn't possibly
leave Ningzhou alive.)

♪Citywide fireworks startle old dreams♪

♪Cold wind lifts temple strands♪

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.280
Who knows what trickery he's up to

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.960
with that medicine?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.280
And you believed him?

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.800
Your heart softened?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.480
This is a matter of life.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.280
No room for jokes.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.840
Only Lord Gao can save him now.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.720
You know I've always hated him

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.000
and always loathed the Lu family.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.320
Why should I make Gao Fu save him?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.040
I beg you.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.360
Just... Just consider it
helping me repay a debt, alright?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.360
Repay a debt for you?

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.400
Who do you think you are?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.080
Ye Qinglan.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.472
Just now at the entrance,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.000
they told me to take off my clothes.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.640
Was that your order?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.200
What?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.040
Can't take them off?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.560
I can take them off.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.880
Haven't I taken them all off?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.720
If you wish to look,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.160
you may look

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.240
whenever you want.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.080
You really think
I wouldn't dare to take you?

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.360
If you show mercy,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.680
I'll offer myself every day

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.080
and every night,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.080
until you are satisfied.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.680
Ye Qinglan.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.280
To save him,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.520
you'd go to such lengths?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.280
What?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.400
Why have you stopped?

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040
Don't you know how?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.800
Let me teach you.

There's broken porcelain on the floor.
Why didn't you avoid it?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.000
It was too dark.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.000
I didn't see it at first.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.000
Later, I thought you meant to punish me.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.560
I know others could save him.

00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:12.768
But I don't want to owe him anything.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.720
You don't want to owe him,
yet you'd owe me?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.440
Don't move.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.440
If it hurts, you may scream.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.920
Thank you, my lord.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.880
Gao Fu will tend to his poison.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.680
Don't worry.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.520
After returning, don't seek me again.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.040
Why don't you ask me

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.240
what you truly wish to ask.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.480
I'll investigate it myself.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.640
My father would never
harm Princess Anhe.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.240
Okay.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.840
Then prove it to me.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.400
Old Drillmaster?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.160
Lady Ye?

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.000
You're actually alive?

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.560
What truly happened back then?
