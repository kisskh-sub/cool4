00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.660
I had a part to play?

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.940
Want me to spell it out so clearly

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.500
in front of all our old friends?

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.140
Mr. Song, if you have evidence,

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.820
just speak freely.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.740
However, Song,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.300
I think you've gone too far

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.260
by disregarding the group's interests

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.540
and turning Starlight Jewelry
into an empty shell.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.820
The board

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.660
has asked you here today to demand

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.140
a full explanation.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.580
Isn't it obvious?

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.540
You're behind this.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.740
You orchestrated the cash flow crisis
at Starlight Jewelry,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.500
then played the hero

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.180
by offering a capital injection.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.140
Everyone knows your ruthless ambition

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.660
and what you're really after.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.580
Song Shan!

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.460
What do you mean by that?

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.260
Don't you dare make
such baseless accusations.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.140
Explain yourself

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.940
to the board now!

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.700
Mr. Ye, calm down.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.220
Everyone can go now.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.140
Let's wrap up the meeting here.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.780
Ye Taiting,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.500
you schemed and calculated,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.020
and what's the result?

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.940
Your plan backfired,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.140
and you actually facilitated
the cooperation

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.100
between Starlight Jewelry
and Jihong Group.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.620
Oh, my poor memory.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.460
It's

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.860
not called Starlight Jewelry anymore.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.380
It's called

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.860
Zhifu Jewelry now.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:54.940
Song.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.180
Does

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.140
your daughter know

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.340
that you're connected to the death

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.300
of Ji Baijian's mother?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:07.900
Ye Taiting,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.220
choose your words carefully.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.020
Some words, once spoken,

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.140
will benefit no one.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.860
Fine.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.900
Then I wish you a successful partnership

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.860
with Jihong Group.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.860
Great.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.380
And I wish Starlight Group

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.580
a successful IPO.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.660
Thank you.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.660
Mr. Ye, calm down.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.860
Darn it.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.180
Ji Yunlei pulled the rug out
from under us with that move.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.260
It was clever.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.980
This is my fault. My carelessness

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.940
messed up your plan.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.620
Guanshu,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.700
this isn't the first time

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.900
you've disrupted my plans, is it?

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:29.860
Dad.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.940
You're back.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.780
Did you get the marriage certificate?

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.740
Let me see.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.760
[Ji Baijian]

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:45.700
Good.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.540
I've made all the preparations

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.620
for the new company.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.780
Baijian, you did well this time.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.180
We can finally avenge your mother.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.900
Do you know how long
I've waited for this day?

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.940
Countless times, I've dreamed
of the agonized look

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.580
on your mother's face when she left us.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.660
She told me to get revenge for her.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.220
She said if it weren't for Song Shan,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.660
our family would still

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.100
be happily together.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.100
Alright, enough of this.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.460
Now your mother

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.580
can rest in peace.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.220
Thank you.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:40.820
Baijian.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.180
It's nothing.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.020
I'm going to my room to rest.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.340
Okay.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.660
Think about it.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.820
Who was it that stood by you
through all the ups and downs?

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.220
And who got you through all those

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.900
lonely, unbearable nights?

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.340
Ever since Song Zhizhi came along,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.780
I've become the third wheel.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.500
You don't even look my way anymore.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.900
If you keep this up, I'm leaving.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.700
You're getting married tomorrow.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.180
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.260
But seriously, Ji,

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.460
it hasn't been easy for you

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.780
all these years.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.220
Others might not know,

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.260
but I've seen it all.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.140
There's something
I've kept to myself for a long time.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.460
I have to tell you today.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.780
You're great

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.260
in every way,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.340
but you have one flaw.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.900
You're too governed by your emotions.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.540
I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.740
I'm just saying the only one
who ends up suffering is you.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.100
Take this situation
with your father, for example.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.420
You have your goals.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.300
And he can help you achieve them.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.900
Helping him is helping yourself.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.020
But let me give you one piece of advice.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.660
Don't let all this hatred consume you.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.820
There are still

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.660
many wonderful things in life.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.580
I want you to live a little easier.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.460
Since you've been with Zhizhi,

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.100
you've changed completely.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.140
But I can tell

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.500
you're tormented inside.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.620
You want to confess your entire plan

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.860
to her,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.180
but you're afraid
of upsetting your father.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.380
Man,

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.940
you should think about yourself
when making decisions.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.420
Can you please shut up?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.060
Fine, I'll stop.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.260
But the path you take from here

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.220
is yours to decide.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.700
I'm actually grateful to Zhizhi.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.980
You have her by your side.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.060
I just hope you'll always be happy,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.540
always be joyful,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.380
always be loved.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.180
I wish you happiness too.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.060
Ji,

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.820
happy wedding.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:41.700
Dad.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.260
You must be tired today.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.820
It's no trouble at all.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.620
You're my only daughter.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:49.980
Of course,

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.660
I'd handle your wedding myself.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.700
By the way,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.780
Zhiyan went to Europe
with his mentor for a research trip.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.180
He couldn't get time off.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.180
He was afraid to tell you himself,
worried you'd be angry.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.620
So he asked me to tell you

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.820
he'll make it up to you
next time he's back.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.540
He went to Europe?

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.820
It seems his photography career

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.220
is going well.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.580
And about your grandma's health,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.860
the doctor said
she must avoid any excitement.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.100
So I didn't dare

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.780
tell her about your wedding.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.780
It's alright, Dad. After the wedding,

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.820
Baijian and I will visit her together.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.980
Zhizhi,

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.780
I'm getting old.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.020
When you're old,
you tend to dwell on past memories.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.540
Your mom left us early.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.780
I was always buried in work,

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.940
just counting the days

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.140
until you two were grown
and independent.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.380
But now that you are,

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.100
with Zhiyan abroad

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.500
and you about to get married,

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.380
I do feel

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.020
a bit lost in my heart.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.580
I remember when you were little,

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.460
you'd both come running

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.380
the moment I got home,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.580
chattering and making a racket.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.220
Sometimes it really got on my nerves.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.940
But looking back,

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.500
those were such happy times.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.980
Well, you're all grown up now.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.140
You have your own lives.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.300
And you are getting married.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.260
Soon, it'll just be me left
in this house.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.380
I just feel...

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.740
Dad, I'm just getting married.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.380
It's not like I'll never come back.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.820
Once Baijian and I are married,

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.500
we'll come back often.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.740
I hope you won't find us a nuisance.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.580
Zhizhi,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.740
let me ask you.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.780
Is Baijian really sincere with you?

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.580
Dad, why do you ask all of a sudden?

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.300
It's nothing.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.980
You're my only daughter.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.620
Now I'm about to

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.500
hand you over to another man.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.900
I just can't bear to let you go.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.100
I know what you're worried about.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.860
You're worried

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.420
Baijian has an ulterior motive
for being with me,

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.100
for marrying me.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.020
You're afraid our marriage

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.420
will become a business transaction.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.540
You're worried he won't treat me well,

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.940
that he can't make me happy.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.300
Dad, I doubted him too

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.300
at first.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.620
So I kept my distance from him.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.980
When we renewed the engagement,

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.900
I had my own reasons.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.860
I hoped he could help Starlight Jewelry.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.940
But later I realized

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.540
he wasn't who I thought

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.460
he was.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.380
He risked his life

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.780
to save Zhiyan.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.300
Later, at the shareholders' meeting,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.260
he gave me all his shares

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.100
to support me.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.140
And after that,

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.180
he went with me to see Grandma.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.020
He's spoken to me with such honesty.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.420
Everything I've felt from him
has been genuine.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.660
He makes me feel secure.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.780
Dad,

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.940
I believe he can make me happy.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.220
That's good.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.140
Zhizhi,

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.380
you've really grown up.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.740
And you've been through so much.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.460
I believe you have your own judgment.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.300
And I believe
you've made the right choice.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.820
Since you've chosen Baijian,

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.700
I'll trust him too.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.100
I believe he'll make you happy.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.100
You're getting married tomorrow.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.260
Every couple will have arguments.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.620
You can't be willful anymore.
