[Episode 9]

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.190
Miss Yixiao went to see Xia Jingshi?

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.000
Then the two of them are

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.500
old friends reunited.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.240
They must be hugging and crying

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.960
as they pour out their feelings right now.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.230
Do you want to go check on her?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.730
Well, that won't be necessary...

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.640
No, I mean...

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.630
No need.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.600
There's really no need, Your Highness.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.510
It's alright.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.829
It's okay if you don't remember.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.630
We have plenty of time ahead.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.560
I'll make sure

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.020
you stand by my side again.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.030
Stand by your side?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.770
Even if you don't remember anything,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.380
I still want you to know

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.470
you're the only one
my heart belongs to in this life.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.560
We once vowed before the heavens

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.160
to spend our lives together.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.800
Yixiao.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.240
Losing you was

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.040
my greatest regret in this life,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.050
but finding you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.750
is

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.230
my greatest fortune.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.870
Yixiao.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.200
I understand

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.590
that you don't remember anything.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.870
To you,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.200
I'm just a stranger now.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.870
It's normal for you to feel distant.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.790
I'm sorry.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.750
But to me,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.000
you're not just a female general
under my command,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.520
but also the one closest to me,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.650
the one I trust most.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.829
The one closest to you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.340
and you trust most?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.030
I remember Your Highness once said to me

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.400
that after the Battle of Pingling,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.470
you'd marry me.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.710
You don't need to worry.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.710
I'm not here to force you into marriage.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.870
I just wanted to confirm

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.270
if that really happened.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.680
After all, marriage is no trivial matter.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.480
In the past that I've forgotten,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.680
what kind of person

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.540
were you exactly, Your Highness?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.470
Yes,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.120
I did speak of marrying you.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.640
No wonder.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.080
So there really was

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.180
an engagement between us.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.000
It's just...

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.630
It's just about our engagement,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.440
I'm afraid I must break my promise.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.190
Our Emperor has decreed

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.190
that I come to Susha
for a marriage alliance

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.890
and wed Princess Xiyang.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.170
I cannot defy the imperial order.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.120
I'm not afraid to die myself,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.680
but my men who have followed me

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.810
for so many years...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.650
You don't have to explain so much,
Your Highness,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.040
and you don't need to worry.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.950
To me,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.730
you're just a stranger now.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.520
This marriage alliance

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.830
will bring peace back to both kingdoms,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.520
and that's a good thing.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.120
Do you really think so?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.720
Of course.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.000
I don't remember anything anyway.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
What's in the past

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.840
is in the past.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.070
I came here today

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.910
only hoping Your Highness

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.450
could tell me about my past,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.430
about how I became a general,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.490
about my martial skills

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.170
and my archery.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.950
Ever since I learned about
your memory loss,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.510
I've been recording

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.510

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.500

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.610
it would be of use some day,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.040
and you'd want to know

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.500
what happened in the past.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.720
I hope to help you

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.610
as much as I can.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.970

In late autumn of the fourth year
of Zhengxiang,

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.960
Xiao Weiran was captured by enemy forces.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.660
I was in Pingling City

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.240
investigating the death camp's hideouts,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.240
and at one of them,

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.320
I rescued you,

After that,

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.580
I wiped out all the hideouts

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.660

this will be your home.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.630
After the death camp was wiped out,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.440
you joined the Zhennan Army.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.360
We became comrades who trusted

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.760
and relied on each other.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.360
In summer of the fifth year
of Zhengxiang,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.620
outside Zhennan Pass,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.850
we were ambushed by the Susha forces.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.200
The Susha forces outnumbered us
several times over,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.400
and our troops were quickly scattered.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.150
Later, the two of us got surrounded,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.750
and it was you who fought alongside me
in a bloody battle

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.280

Since I was shot off the cliff by an arrow

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.570
after the Battle of Pingling,

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.480
then all the twists and turns

should have started from that point.

She left?

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.360
She said she was going to Zhengnian Hall

in the kitchen this morning.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.480

for the kids,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.670
but she said it was a toy
for Your Highness.

I don't know

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.720
what her intention was.

At least she knows to leave me a message.

Now that's more like cooperation.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.020

in the phrase "spider's thread
and 'ma' track",

what does the character "ma" refer to?

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.910
No, it's the "ma" in "zao ma",
which is camel cricket.

have always been Susha's territory.

It's only due to years of warfare

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.620
that officials neglected their offices

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.960

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.060
is irrelevant.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.920
Since he doesn't approve,

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.000
he would try to stop it

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.130
even if it means killing Xia Jingshi.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.920
If I force him,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.480
he might even go so far

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.040
as to burn down my palace
without hesitation.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.680
Daring to do anything,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.600
yet still holding onto his principles—

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.310
that's my son.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.150
Your Majesty speaks wisely.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.680
The First Prince has indeed been

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.010
unusually calm lately.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.480
Let's wait and see.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.680
Boss,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.740
I want this one.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.590
Stop there!

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.650
[Ye's Suzhou Embroidery]

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.400
Your Highness,

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.160
your plan

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.480
is absolutely brilliant.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.810
Did you see clearly?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.750
I did.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.750
That man is

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.160
a personal guard of the Prince of Zhennan.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.000
But Yun Fang recognized him

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.660
as a Jinxiu undercover guard.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.680
Your Highness, I was thinking,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.680
how could a Jinxiu undercover guard

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.960
have any connection with

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.560
with Prime Minister Zhuang?

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.810
There's only one explanation:

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.680
Xia Jingshi must be secretly colluding

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.280
with Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.550
Perhaps it was exactly because Miss Yixiao

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.680
found out about this

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.960
that she got in mortal danger.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.480
That Xia Jingshi came to Yujing

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.230
specifically to

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.720
take Miss Yixiao back with him.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.240
All that talk
about exchanging the captives,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.640
isn't it just an excuse to

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.110
take Miss Yixiao back?

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.220
I had to open my mouth.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.750
I dug too deep.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.590
Someone give me a beating.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.640
What secret could Yixiao

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.440
possibly know that's worth them

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.110
coming all the way to Yujing

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.160
to kill her?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.330
Where's the letter they were passing?

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.480
You said not to alert them,

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.140
so I didn't dare intercept it.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.450
Never mind.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.530
A letter delivered by servants

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.720
probably doesn't contain

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.250
any valuable clues anyway.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.350
Have someone watch
the prime minister's residence closely.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.150
Report to me if there's any news.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.350
Yes, Your Highness.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.310
Well, are you going to

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.920
tell Miss Yixiao about this?

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.240
Tell her what?

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.760
That Xia Jingshi wants to kill her?

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.690
I don't have solid proof right now.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.590
Even if I told her,

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.750
she'd just think
I'm trying to cause trouble.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.880
Better to let her discover it herself.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.030
She once fought by his side wholeheartedly

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.160
to build his empire,

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.380
but now he discards her
like worn-out shoes.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.270
If it were you, what would you do?

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.010
Would you want revenge?

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.550
Your Highness.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.470
If one day

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.020
you want to discard me
like worn-out shoes,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.090
you wouldn't need to plot against me.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.090
Just say the word,

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.520
and I'd come willingly to my death.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.390
Hey.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.880
What kind of reaction is that?

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.160
I'm telling the truth, Your Highness!

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.250
Really.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.160
I mean it.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.490
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers!

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.370
Fill it up.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.270
Your shoulder is injured.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.930
Let me do it.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.160
Yixiao.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.510
You still drink from big bowls

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.510
just like before.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.270
You're still you.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.610
You've never changed.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.790
Yixiao, you're lying to us, right?

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.590
You've never truly

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.920
forgotten us, have you?

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.160
I'm sorry.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.080
I truly don't remember.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.750
Here.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.730
Let me show you something.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.930
You should remember this, right?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.750
You may forget everything else,

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.750
but you can't possibly forget this.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.820
This is from the battle at Changyu Pass.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.960
This arrow was meant to pierce

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.880
my chest.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.400
It was only because you saved me

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.330
that it didn't hit my vital organs.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.000
Ning Fei!

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.200
But this arrow was poisonous.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.270
It was also you who

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.000
took a knife and carefully

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.560
cut open my wound

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.070
to drain the poisoned blood.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.310
If it weren't for you,

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.270
I would have died long ago.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.680
Cheers!

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.310
You must remember this, right?

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.350
Come on.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.240
Roll up your pant leg.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
You have the same scar as I do.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.610
Mine's on...

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.900
Mines' on the right leg,
and yours is on the left.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.720
Roll it up.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.370
They're identical.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.010
Look,

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.080
our scars are exactly the same.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.790
I was shot with a cold arrow

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.790
during the battle at Qianshui Pass,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.070
and you got yours protecting His Highness

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.730
when a prisoner attacked you.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.970
Our wounds were

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:18.750
about a month apart.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.480
You took care of me for two weeks,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.120
and then I took care of you for two weeks.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.120
The whole camp

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.150
was laughing at us back then.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.720
Right, Weiran?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.720
Alright, that's enough. You're drunk.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.520
Stop talking.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.270
I'm not drunk.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.600
I don't believe this.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.550
Roll up your shirt

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:46.750
and show her your back.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:47.720
Hey, enough.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.350
Yixiao, look.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.310
Look.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.400
You don't remember?

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.500
The enemy burned our barracks,

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.640
and Weiran risked his life
rushing into the flames

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.390
to save us.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.340
That's how he got these burns.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.640
Enough, Ning Fei.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.230
Why tell her all this?

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.290
I'm worried that if I didn't tell her,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.790
she'd forget.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.730
Yixiao.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.560
After you fell off the cliff,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.640
this guy here

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.940
didn't say anything,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.840
but I know

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.040
he was even more worried than I was.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.140
That's just how he is,

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.880
keeping everything bottled up inside.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.350
It's a joyful day today.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.830
Let's drink!

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.450
Let's drink!

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:15.640
Come on.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.000
Cheers!

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.090
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.760
How did we

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.950
fight side by side before?

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.350
We Three Heroes of Jinxiu

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.880
each had our own strengths.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.580
You were an exceptional archer.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.560
I was unmatched in bravery.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.790
And Weiran was a master strategist.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.200
The three of us

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.510
trusted each other the most.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.200
We were sworn siblings
who'd die for each other.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.290
Sister Xueying.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.400
What are Master and Brother Ning Fei

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.760
talking about?

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.680
Exactly.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.920
They've been talking for six hours.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.510
Indeed.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.000
Sister Yixiao

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.560
wants to uncover the truth.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.830
The person who shot her

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.430
must be someone close to her.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.180
As long as she doesn't uncover the truth,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.780
she won't have peace of mind.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.530
I hope the truth

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.260
won't break her heart.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.480
Ning Fei.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.240
After hearing everything you said,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.510
I never imagined we went through

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.110
so many life-and-death situations
together.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.610
Since you're truly my brother in arms,

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.640
please help me think—

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.070
what exactly happened

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:31.670
the day I fell off that cliff?

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.830
At that time,

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.750
everyone was celebrating the victory
of the Battle of Pingling,

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.720
but you were nowhere to be found.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.040
The next day,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.680
a guard came and told us

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.340
you fell off the cliff

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.760
by accident.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.560
So I fell off the cliff by accident?

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.810
Then tell me more about

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.780
the Battle of Pingling—

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.050
how did we fight it,

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.400
and how did we win?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.330
The Battle of Pingling?

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.750
At first,

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.790
we planned to close
all borders and passages.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:12.790
His Highness said

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.310
that no matter what,

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.160
we must hold the city.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.550
But later,

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.040
His Highness set up an ambush
inside the pass,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.880
so as long as Feng Suige

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.550
broke through Zhennan Pass,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.070
he would be doomed.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.510
So according to what you're saying,

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.420
when I shot an arrow at Feng Suige,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.920
I not only failed to kill him,

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.250
but actually saved him?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.820
He was just lucky.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.590
Besides,

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:44.840
you...

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.570
At that time,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.040
you had no idea

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.550
why His Highness would

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.120
suddenly change his plan

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.120
the day before Susha's attack.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.570
Change his plan?

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.400
Why did he suddenly change his plan?

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.150
A military report was delivered

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.170
to His Highness before the battle.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.640
Isn't that right?

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.370
I'm not asking you.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.990
Isn't that right, Weiran?

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.750
No more drinking.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.470
Say it.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.480
What military report?

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.160
Tell her, Weiran.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.500
I can't drink anymore.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.680
What military report was so important?

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.510
What report?

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.960
I have no idea.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.540
I'm going to sleep.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.590
Feng Suige said

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.920
someone from Susha colluded with
their enemy during the Battle of Pingling.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.320
Could that intelligence

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.400
have been ordered to be delivered
by that traitor

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.310
from Susha?

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.680
Please escort those two

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.720
safely to the inn.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.240
Yes.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.270
Yixiao.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.580
Your Highness?

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.160
What are you doing here?

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:05.270
I saw that Ning Fei and Weiran

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.240
still hadn't returned.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.200
I was worried, so I came to check on them.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.730
Don't worry. They're fine.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.920
They just got drunk out of happiness.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.180
They're the carriage.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.640
I've reached an agreement with Susha,

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.440
and they've agreed to let you go.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.060
Ning Fei had told me about it.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.440
Then we shouldn't delay.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.040
Come with me to the inn today.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.270
I'll ask someone to
escort you back first tomorrow,

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.070
and we'll meet in Pingling City.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.550
That won't be necessary.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.810
I don't plan to go back.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.800
You still don't trust me.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.110
It's not that I don't trust you.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.030
I just have some unfinished

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:43.890
business here.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.150
Your Highness,

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.440
why are you so eager to take me back?

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.350
Susha is an enemy kingdom after all.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.920
Only if you return to Jinxiu

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.320
can I ensure your safety.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.550
Are you sure she'll be safer there?

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.890
The one who wanted to kill her

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.510
is from Jinxiu,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.720
not from Susha.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:16.620
Yixiao.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.200
Ever since you fell off the cliff,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.270
I've had people investigating

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.050
the truth behind your fall.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.550
After investigating for so long,

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.440
do you have any leads now,
Prince of Zhennan?

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.370
This is Jinxiu's internal affair.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.400
What does it have to do with you?

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.130
She's a member of my household.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.950
Logically speaking,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.400
whoever wants to kill her

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.940
should be considered my domestic business.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.740
I'm not really familiar with him.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.660
Miss Yixiao,

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.410
how could you be so heartless?

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.350
Have you forgotten that

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.270
on that cliff,

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.880
the one who could have shot you
with an arrow

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.030
must be someone you deeply trusted?

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.480
If His Highness wanted me dead,

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.920
a single military order
would have sufficed,

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.850
and I would have perished long ago.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.680
Besides, whoever wants to kill me

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.840
is my own concern.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.560
It's none of your business,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.510
Your Highness First Prince.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.710
If there's nothing else,

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:11.510
please leave.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.540
Yixiao,

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.190
then...

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.000
Your Highness, if there's nothing else,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.260
please return as well.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.590
You didn't actually believe

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.050
she'd go with you, did you?

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.670
It seems you have

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.389
some grievances against me, First Prince.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:33.400
If I did something

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.929
to upset you, First Prince,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.850
please don't take it to heart.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.949
Your wounds haven't healed yet,

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.870
and anger is bad for your health.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.610
Your person wounded me,

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.110
and now she has fallen

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.000
into my hands.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.280
You see,

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.800
it seems even heaven itself

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.530
won't let me suffer injustice.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.090
By the way,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.710
First Prince,
you probably don't know it yet,

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.000
but the two kingdoms
are already negotiating

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.280
the specific terms
of the marriage alliance.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.230
Prime Minister Zhuang has also approved

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:00.480
the terms for prisoner exchange
between our kingdoms.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.560
Before long,

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.460
Yixiao will come back with me.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.630
Prisoner?

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.410
She's not my prisoner.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.630
Who told you

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:08.760
she was my prisoner?

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.830
Have you ever seen a prisoner

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.650
with such freedom as hers?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.550
Whether she's a prisoner or not,

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.680
she's still Jinxiu's female general.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.480
Since she's free,

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.230
then whether she stays or leaves

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.190
should be her own decision.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.000
All right.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.920
Let her make her own decision.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.000
I hope you'll

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.760
keep your word, First Prince.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.440
You seem very confident.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.590
You don't understand

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.120
the bond between me and her.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.800
Of course I don't.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.660
How could a human ever understand

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.190
why a beast would suddenly turn on them
without mercy?

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.720
Yixiao will soon remember everything

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.440
and come back to me.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.110
Are you truly not afraid

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.800
of that day coming?

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.180
Please go upstairs.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.850
Once you arrive in Jinxiu,

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.710
you'll have to rely on yourself

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.240
for the path ahead.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.280
But no matter what happens,

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.280
always remember

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.760
that you are Susha's

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.090
most beloved princess.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.690
You have the right

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.630
and the standing to obtain

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.030
anything you desire.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.230
Mother,

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.150
can I really get

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.890
anything I want?

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.630
Of course.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.520
You have your father,

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.370
me,

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.190
and the entire Susha behind you.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.110
No one can make you

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.370
suffer any grievance.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.240
That's right.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.050
I'm the Princess of Susha.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.320
No matter who His Highness

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.320
liked in the past,

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.760
I'll be his wife from now on.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.640
The Red-Clad General of Jinxiu,

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.960
so valiant and heroic,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.840
a woman matching any man's courage.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.030
Meeting you today confirms all I've heard.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.490
You flatter me, Princess.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.480
Since you arranged to meet me today,

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.610
there must be some important matter
you wish to discuss.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.150
I came to see you

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.510
to tell you that

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.340
I know everything about your past

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.530
with the Prince of Zhennan.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.550
Don't worry,

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.230
I mean no harm.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.940
We're all humans with feelings.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.510
You've followed His Highness
for so many years,

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.070
fighting alongside him
through life and death.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:24.880
You're a woman,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.510
yet you were always
by His Highness's side.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.780
It's inevitable that
he developed feelings for you.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.380
I don't care about the history
between you two.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.400
Let bygones be bygones.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.460
The future is what matters most.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.960
After I marry His Highness,

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.840
I'll be by his side every day.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.360
By then,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
there will be no more war
between our two kingdoms,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.230
and His Highness won't need to
go to battle anymore.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.400
I'll work with him to protect

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.200
the peace between our kingdoms.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.840
If you wish to stay here in our mansion,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.360
I'll treat you well.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.070
If you prefer to stay
in the military camp,

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.110
I'll also certainly have His Highness

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.710
arrange a suitable

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.000
position for you.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.110
If you truly didn't care,

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.610
you wouldn't have come to see me today.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.400
Your Highness is about to marry far
from home.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.510
You should focus more on

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.440
your own future.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.600
My business

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.400
is none of your concern.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.440
Since the two kingdoms
are having a marriage alliance,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.090
Father has declared a general amnesty,

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.360
and the whole kingdom is celebrating.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360
Yujing City today

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.320
will surely be bustling with excitement.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.530
Miss Yixiao,

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.000
why don't you join me and His Highness

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.330
to see the festivities?

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.610
I don't like crowds.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.890
Are you afraid?

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.250
Afraid of what?

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.280
Since Your Highness has kindly invited me,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.540
I shall respectfully accept your offer.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.230
Bravo! Bravo!

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.920
Miss Yixiao,
you were wrong about something.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.710
It's not true that

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.590
I haven't planned for my own future.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.520
On the contrary,

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.400
I'm fully aware of

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.630
what life awaits me

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.460
after I marry into Jinxiu.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.320
Actually,

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:13.960
the Prince of Zhennan and I

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.800
have known each other for a long time.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.560
He not only saved my life,

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.330
but also has affection for me.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.970
Why else would I marry him?

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.700
He's Jinxiu's Prince of Zhennan,

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.280
with high status
and great power in Jinxiu.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.940
And I'm the Princess of Susha,

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.110
so our positions are well-matched.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.000
It seems

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.230
he never told you about

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.760
the past between us.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.030
Did you not hear what I said?

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.800
May you two live happily ever after.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:03.920
Stop the carriage.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.770
[Coffin Shop]

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.740
Your Highness.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.320
In public, I'll call you Young Master Xia,

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.710
and you can call me Xiyang.
Is that all right?

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:31.240
Alright,

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280
Princess Xiyang.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.110
I've heard you

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.710
mention Miss Yixiao before,

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.840
and I was quite curious,

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.330
so I wanted to meet her.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:40.120
Besides, Yujing City is very lively today,

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.630
[Coffin Shop]

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.710
so I invited her to come sightseeing
with me.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.190
Your...

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.360
Do you mind, Young Master Xia?

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.220
You invited someone from my household,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.190
yet you're asking for

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.280
his opinion?

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.280
Brother?

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.390
What brings you here?

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.630
It's rare to see you
in such a leisurely mood,

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.520
coming out for a stroll.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.180
I'll accompany you for a walk.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.920
Didn't you say you dislike crowds?

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.170
I don't,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.070
but she does.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.550
Don't you also dislike crowds?

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.010
Since we're already here,

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.480
what's wrong with taking a look around?

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.570
The view is better over there.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.480
Let's go.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.730
Let go.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:34.820
Don't forget,

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.620
you're still my concubine.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.170
Don't push your luck.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.700
You did forget?

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.190
How about I make a sound

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.510
to remind the entire city

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.370
that you, Fu Yixiao, belong to me?

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.310
I want Xia Jingshi to see

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.910
that his beloved general

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.110
is now mine.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.670
Xiyang!

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:55.760
Come on!

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:56.760
Coming.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:01.110
Let's go.
