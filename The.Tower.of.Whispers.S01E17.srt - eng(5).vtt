Your Majesty.

Yingying.

It's been over 10 years.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.560
You've grown up.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.870
Mother, if you're here to reminisce,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.000
there's no need.

[Lingxi, Holy Maiden of the Yue State,
Jun Che's mother]

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.680
If you have come
as the representative of the envoys,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.840
I have already received the gifts.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.470
Back then, I failed you as a mother.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.360
Mother, please don't abandon me.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.870
Take me with you, please.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.710
Why?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840
Why?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.520
The storybooks say

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.750
all mothers love their children.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.560
Why have you never loved me?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.600
Look at those eyes of yours.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.960
So much like your father's.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.870
And your body,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.570
with half of it
running with his filthy blood.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.600
You don't deserve my love!

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.480
Mother!

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.560
Then I'll give back to you
all the filthy blood

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.090
that runs in this half of me!

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.390
Mother!

right here?

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.120
Years ago, when the secret guards
of the State of Yue rescued you

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.870
from the arena
and brought you back to the Yue State

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.800
I was in seclusion,
recovering from my wounds.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.160
I was too weak to see you.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.630
But when I heard your wound
caused you pain day and night,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.290
I mixed my blood into medicine

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.070
to make this ointment for you.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.800
I want to see

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.000
what reason you have for making me wait.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.630
My empress, you're not
in our bedchamber late at night.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.310
Are you planning to flee our marriage?

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.920
That depends on whether you're hiding

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.870
someone from me.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.950
I'm not ready for you to meet her yet.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.810
So you really are hiding someone?

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.480
How dare you treat me
like this on our wedding night?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.280
Perhaps I should kill you first,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.430
to spare myself

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.490
the sight of all the other women
you favor in your harem.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.590
She's not a woman I favor,

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.270
but a foe.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.390
She's your mother?

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.120
In my previous life,
when I married into the palace,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.750
his mother was already dead.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.360
I never thought in this life

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.160
I would see her alive.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.920
Yingying.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.750
Do you think a mother
who didn't love her child

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.610
can truly become a loving mother?

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.159
She apologized to you,

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.290
begging for your forgiveness, right?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.659
Do you think I should forgive her?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.850
Love that comes too late
is better left unwanted.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.360
As expected of my wife.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.360
We said the same thing.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.950
Can an ointment that's 15 years late

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.480
heal old wounds?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.510
Keeping this scar

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.720
serves as a reminder to me

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.920
of what abandonment feels like.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.120
I understand your purpose in coming today.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.160
You want to remind me

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.560
that Yue State saved me.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.450
Rest assured, I will keep my promise.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.040
Yue State helped me ascend the throne,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.360
so I will integrate Yue State into Daning.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.820
If you think of me this way,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.830
I don't blame you.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.680
But I truly don't want

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.800
only hatred to remain between us.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.480
After all, in your body

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.210
flows blood that belongs to me,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.000
to Yue State.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.430
Back then,

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.430
you abandoned me because I had

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.270
Daning blood flowing in my veins.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.000
Now because of my other half bloodline,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.560
you want to restore
our mother-son relationship.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.310
Mother,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.680
don't you find it ridiculous?

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.000
Che.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.510
According to the law, envoys

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.240
cannot stay long in the palace.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.480
Please leave.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.190
Che!

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.920
Che!

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.040
Do you remember this?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.800
I took it away back then

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.490
just to keep something to remember you by.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.560
Now,

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.710
it can finally return
to its true owner.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.830
Do you like it?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.980
I'll play with you.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.030
I am no longer a child.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.650
I don't need it anymore.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.669
Che! Che!

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:39.960
Actually,

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.750
I only have 6 months left to live.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.600
I just want to

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.900
remember your face well before I die.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.200

After 3 days,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.840
you will return
to Yue State with the other envoys.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.630
Che!

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.910

Che.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.510
It's okay.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.850
I'll be by your side from now on.
