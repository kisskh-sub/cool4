=Episode 26=

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.760
Old Drillmaster?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.520
Lady Ye?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.360
You're actually alive?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.920
What truly happened back then?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.360
Old Drillmaster, Lady Ye and I
are on the same side.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000
Don't worry.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.440
You don't need to hide anything
from either of us.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.600
Sit and explain.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.880
Old Drillmaster, my father maintained
good relations with Princess Anhe.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.360
Why would he poison her?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.880
Didn't you find that suspicious?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.440
Lord Shen makes a valid point.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.200
Princess Anhe discovered
the postmaster colluded

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.800
with the Lu family

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.200
and harbored pirates.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.840
So they need to silence her.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.880
If my father intended this,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.600
he could've found a scapegoat,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.720
instead of implicating himself.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.680
Old Drillmaster, think carefully.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.520
Perhaps we can uncover new leads.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.960
Your Highness,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.200
we must leave now!

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.360
Let me take one last look.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.120
Just one last look.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.880
If you don't leave now,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.080
since you noticed
the pearl smuggling and pirates.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.200
They won't let you leave Ningzhou alive.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.320
Your Highness.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.640
Please send the child to the capital.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.120
They want me dead.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.200
I can't escape with the child.

00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:38.976
Postmaster Sang!

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.320
The child's name is Yin Ruxing.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.000
Old Drillmaster,
ensure Princess Anhe escapes too.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.000
Okay.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.720
My lady, let's go.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.360
Hurry up.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.360
Or it'll be too late.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.080
That day was chaotic.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.240
My father carried Princess Anhe's child,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.360
urging my brother and me to flee.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.680
He kept apologizing.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.280
We didn't know what happened.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.560
We just obeyed him.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.160
Even now, the reason eludes us.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.520
Kids, listen. Once you pass this gate,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.160
Nanny Chen awaits at Lianqiao Alley.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.520
Just run. Don't look back.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.800
Father, where are we going?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
Ye, there's money and provisions
in this bundle.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.480
And a crucial letter too.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.440
Take Mu with you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.800
and hide at the rural estate.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.400
Wait for me to retrieve you.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.680
If I don't return,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.840
(Duting Station)
live well with Mu.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.320
Someday,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.920
deliver this letter
to the Duke Xuan's Mansion.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.720
Did you get that?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.240
Yes. Go to the countryside
without looking back,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.720
and give the letter
to Princess Anhe's family.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.600
Go! Hurry!

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.320
Run! Don't look back!

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.480
Hurry!

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.400
Later,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.160
the assassins found us.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.520
And I gave the bundle to Mu,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.840
diverting the assassins myself.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.960
Then I was captured.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.320
Where's Master Mu now?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.320
Passed away recently.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.640
I'm sorry.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.800
I hid for too long.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.360
I was terrified then.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.360
Princess Anhe died in the carriage.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.360
After her death,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.840
I... I fled.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.720
If my father intended
to silence witnesses,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.760
why did he ask me and my brother to run,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.720
yet sent you to escort Princess Anhe?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.560
Doesn't that contradict his motive?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.240
It's really weird.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.160
They didn't act all these years.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.760
Why suddenly target you now?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.160
We previous co-workers

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.320
hid for survival all these years.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.960
Burdened by guilt,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.320
we tried sending accusations
to the capital.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.280
But they were all intercepted
by Madam Lu.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.600
How do you know it was Madam Lu?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.696
The Lus are imperial merchants.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.320
Pearl shipments and courier routes

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.200
were the same.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.200
The inspectors

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.760
were all from the Lu family
and the capital.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.920
Intercepting accusations

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.560
would be effortless for them.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.200
No wonder.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.800
If your brother's letter
to the Duke Xuan's Mansion

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.440
hadn't been sent from Taodu,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.880
it would've surely been intercepted too.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.040
(Late Brother, Sang Xiaomu)

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.120
Earlier, I had Gao Fu

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.520
bury your brother

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.800
temporarily here,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.720
waiting for you
to select a proper burial site.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.720
When Mu was young, he told me

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.120
he'd rather die

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.080
than coexist with worms and ants.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.920
He wanted to become an eagle,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.720
soaring to the sky.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.160
Sister,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.640
do you believe

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.680
I'll grow this tall someday.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.280
Then I'll protect you.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.440
Mu.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.360
(Late Brother, Sang Xiaomu)

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.640
You've made it now.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.840
(Don't worry.)

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.520
(I'll take your place in protecting her)

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.760
(and spare her from further harm.)

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.400
How cruel he was.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360
All these years,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.480
he stayed by my side

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.920
protecting Jin and me,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.160
yet never revealed his identity.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.080
Not until I recognized him

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760
did we even

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.480
get to properly talk,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.080
and he...

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.760
(Your sister doesn't truly resent you.)

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.160
(If possible,
visit her dreams more often)

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.880
(to keep her company)

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.280
(and make up for lost time.)

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.680
(If your spirit still watches over us,)

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.960
(help me tell her)

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.600
(that in this world,)

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.000
(someone still loves her
as you and your parents did.)

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.304
With this treatment,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.400
if he wakes within three days,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.720
he'll survive the crisis.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.360
Thank you, Lord Gao.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.560
Farewell, my lady.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.960
Lord Gao.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.320
Lord Shen has given me an order.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.320
Didn't they claim

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.920
your family and Master Lu
killed Princess Anhe?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.520
Then let Madam Lu confirm herself

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.560
if it's true or not.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.880
Farewell, my lady.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.720
They said this to Shi'an
when he was sick?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.160
I never expected Prefect Xia
would shift blame

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.920
onto the deceased Master Lu.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.680
I told him to say that.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560
How could a dead son's reputation

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.960
compare to a functional ally?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.960
It's a pity.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.880
This allay proves useless now.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.760
How?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.640
He hid the groom's involvement from me.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.120
He wanted the groom

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.760
to tell Shen Que how Princess Anhe died.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.640
Who in Ningzhou Prefecture

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.600
surpasses me in poisoncraft?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.760
He used these petty tricks

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.320
to redirect Shen Que's suspicions
toward you,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.080
slaying with borrowed blades

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:53.640
to get rid of the Lu family?

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.160
This ally

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.680
must be severed.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.560
Get down!

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.360
This seat isn't meant for you.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.280
Get down.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.960
Has my deference made you forget

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.720
who I serve?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.320
We're both just

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.080
Madam Lu's lapdogs.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.240
Madam.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.200
Scholar Dong.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.280
Had I not

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.720
engineered your rise,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.400
would you enjoy your glory
in Ningzhou today?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.200
I was drunk.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.560
Xia boasted about passing
the imperial exams.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.000
I didn't know what was wrong.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.040
In a rage,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.320
I-I struck him dead accidentally.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.960
Madam Lu treated you both as her own.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.880
She funded your studies,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.480
and even visited you.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.920
Who could foresee this tragedy?

00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:14.200
Let's report this.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.480
Nanny Song, plead
with Madam Lu for mercy.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.960
I beg you.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.440
I'll kowtow.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.600
Please, Nanny Song.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.320
I'll kowtow.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.080
Xia had no family,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.360
only you as his friend.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.520
You stole his identity

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.120
and transformed yourself,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.920
becoming a doubly-listed scholar.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.280
I pitied you

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.920
and made arrangements everywhere

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.600
to ensure your identity

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.280
remained protected.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.000
Did you help me out of genuine pity,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.560
or to groom a Prefect

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.480
to be your Lu family's workhorse?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.800
How dare you!

00:11:01.856 --> 00:11:04.096
You've lived thirty years
longer than you should have.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.240
It's enough.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.960
Today's situation is irreversible.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.480
Do not let momentary cowardice

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.920
condemn more kin to death.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.320
I've arranged everything that follows.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.320
Now just go in peace.

00:12:04.704 --> 00:12:07.168
(Prefect's Mansion)

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.440
(All aforementioned matters)

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.240
(stemed from my insatiable greed.)

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.320
(As Prefect governing this region,)

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.360
(I allowed pirates to harm civilians,
murdered Princess Anhe,)

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.200
(and framed innocents
as well as the Governor-General.)

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.200
(Each crime warrants
ten thousand deaths.)

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.040
(Now that the truth is revealed,)

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.520
(I dare not shamelessly cling to life.)

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.440
(Only death can atone my sins.)

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.640
Lord Xia.
