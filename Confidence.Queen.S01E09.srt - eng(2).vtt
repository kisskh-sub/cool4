Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:59.226
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:13.574
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:31.550
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.251
Found you.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.596
Were you that curious about me?

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.766
Did I appear in your dream again?

00:03:04.143 --> 00:03:06.103
Are you still looking for me?

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:13.861
This is exactly what I wanted.

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:18.240
Rich parents and a guaranteed future.

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:21.160
It's only fair if you also get a penalty.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:23.996
Am I right?

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.127
A trauma that will
always remind you of me.

00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:58.530

EPISODE 9

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.721
Say what you need to say.

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.688
Are you having trouble sleeping?

00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:37.027
Are you having nightmares?

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.574
It's my turn now. That's only fair.

00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.456
I'm going to be his nightmare now.

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:04.972
I think that's him.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.727
Do you have a reservation
with us for today?

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.811
Yes, we do.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.104
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.128
Will you wait here for a second?

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.464
Let me grab the ingredients for dinner.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.218
Are you sure that's him?

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:45.095
Let's just say a glow-down.

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:52.895
So, you're saying the informant
Myung Jin-su could be the culprit?

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:54.229
We'll have to look into it first,

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:57.775
but Myung Jin-su went missing
after he received the reward.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.319
And a year later,
only his skeleton was found.

00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:02.821
Do you think he's not dead?

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:07.576
Nothing's more perfect than that
in hiding his identity.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.536
If Myung Jin-su is alive…

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.623
His son, who is his only family,
would know something?

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.250
I got a really huge fish…

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:18.712
I'm okay!

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:20.255
This one… Gosh.

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:25.636
Look at this. Do you want to take a photo?

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:31.183
An inn would do all this for us? Terrific!

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:34.853
Actually, you're my last guests.

00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:38.690
So I wanted to treat you
to a hearty dinner.

00:06:38.774 --> 00:06:40.400
Are you closing this place down?

00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:46.615
Yes, we're getting fewer tourists.
And I actually got a job in Seoul.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.909
-I see.
-That's actually better.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.619
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:54.540
Oh, that smells good.

00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:55.958
Here.

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:58.877
Oh, that smells good.

00:06:58.961 --> 00:06:59.920
Enjoy your meal.

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.380
No, wait. Why don't you join us?

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:03.132
No, I'm good.

00:07:03.215 --> 00:07:05.008
Come here. This is so much food.

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.678
We can't finish it. Come on and join us.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.976
By the way, it seems I'm a lot younger
than you two. Please drop the honorifics.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.102
-Can we?
-Can we?

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.103
What's your name?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.772
-My name is Myung Gu-ho.
-Gu-ho?

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:19.982
Okay. Here.

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.778
-Gu-ho?
-Yes, Gu-ho.

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:31.493
Oh, you know how to drink.

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:33.537
-Here, one more.
-I can't drink…

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.873
-It must've been tough, right?
-Yes.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:36.957
You must be thirsty.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:41.461
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:42.796
Yes. Cheers.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.428
Do you live here alone?

00:07:50.262 --> 00:07:51.138
Yes.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:55.309
Actually, my grandpa is
in that photo over there.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.853
I used to live with my grandpa.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.480
Then, after he passed away,
I've been living alone.

00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:01.481
What about your father?

00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:05.777
My father was a matroos.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.281
Oh, was your father a sailor?

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.199
Yes.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.201
-One moment.
-Okay.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:14.536
Where did I put it?

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.705
Excuse me for a moment.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.335
Let's search his room first
when he passes out.

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:22.628
Okay.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.005
Stop drinking, by the way,
or you'll get drunk.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.132
James, you stop eating.
Are you here to eat?

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.800
I found it!

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:33.055
This is my father.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:35.974
Oh, you look a lot like your father.

00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:37.267
-You think?
-Yes.

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:39.019
My father…

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:43.649
Well, he promised he'd come
to my elementary school entrance ceremony.

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.068
And?

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.570
He passed away.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.572
Oh, no. What happened?

00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:53.867
But before he passed away, I got a call.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:55.577
What call?

00:08:57.496 --> 00:08:59.915
That if I listened to Uncle,

00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:06.463
if I had a good time with him,
he'd come get me.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.050
Uncle?

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.052
From your mom's side or your dad's?

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.346
Oh, I can't believe
I'm saying this to you.

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:19.935
Was that jerk, I mean…

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:25.482
Was your uncle tall?
Or did he have a husky voice…

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.858
You know what?

00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:29.528
I went to Seoul
for the first time in my life.

00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:34.491
I even went to the theme park,
which was really fun.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.077
But what's the point?

00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:40.122
My dad wasn't with me.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.378
Am I wrong?

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.715
What's the point of all that
without my dad?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.221
Dad promised to come get me.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.186
Jeez.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:07.941
Oh, jeez.

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:18.577
A special pass ticket from March 28, 2000?

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.245
March 28.

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.331
That's the day you were kidnapped.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.628
There must be something
we aren't aware of.

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:58.408
Did you find anything?

00:10:58.492 --> 00:10:59.326
Nothing.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.456
What's that?

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:06.625
Is that an annex?

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.314
CONDOLENCES
SEONGJIN POLICE STATION

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.066
I found it.

00:11:38.657 --> 00:11:39.491
DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.785
-It belongs to Myung Jin-su.
-We found it.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.747
There must be something in here.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.085
GU-HO'S INN

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.880
The recent calls are all Seoul
or Gyeonggi Province numbers.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.425
That uncle guy.

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:59.678
Whenever he called Myung Jin-su,
he always used the pay phone.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:02.139
He hid his identity completely.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.407
There's a photo.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.625
How long have you been here for?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.088
This is the stuffed animal.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:39.092
It's the same one from the attic
where I was locked in.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.971
The photo was sent on April 1.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.973
It was the day
you were saved from kidnapping.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.809
It's also the day
Myung Jin-su made the report call.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:49.936
But you know what?

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:53.356
If they conspired in this scheme,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.486
was it necessary to bring Myung Jin-su's
son from his grandpa's house?

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.156
Right. Especially before
such an important event.

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:02.741
But it would make sense

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:07.996
if Myung Jin-su was
also blackmailed, right?

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:10.999
Then…

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.336
Double kidnapping.

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:32.979
Where's Gu-ho?

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.482
He's downstairs, so don't worry.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:37.776
Where's the money?

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.699
It's here, right here.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.535
Are you sure he's okay?

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:53.875
He's over there.

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:54.876
What?

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:02.676
Where is he…

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:08.723
The man who kidnapped me also kidnapped
Myung Jin-su's son and threatened him

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:10.308
in order to take the reward for himself.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:11.726
And he ended the case neatly

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.979
by making it look like
he tripped and died.

00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:17.983
Myung Jin-su only did what the culprit
told him to do to save his son, Gu-ho.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.902
In the end, he got killed by that jerk.

00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:22.070
Gu-ho.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.699
Gu-ho.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.453
I…

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:34.374
I'm sorry.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.795
Gu-ho was kidnapped just like you.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:43.258
Myung Jin-su had no other choice
in order to save Gu-ho.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.736
Oh, poor him.

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:33.308
Call me when you're in Seoul.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:34.476
Will do.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.145
By the way,
did I make any mistakes last night?

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.481
I drank so much I don't remember…

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.566
No, it was only more fun that way.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.109
I'm glad to hear that.

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:46.571
Thank you for being my last guests.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.823
-See you.
-Yes.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:54.996
Right.

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.457
He's better off without knowing the truth.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.543
It won't be too late even if we tell him
after we find out who it is.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:01.920
"James."

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.129
James.

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.131
Take care!

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:19.521
Voice phishing?

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:20.647
Employment fraud?

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:24.609
Come in.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.582
HAHA JUNGHO

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:43.628

For seafood, Haha Jungho!

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.483
-Hey, Yi-rang. Is that our new target?
-Yes.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:09.571
Ha Jung-ho's parents ran
a small raw fish restaurant by the sea.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:15.618
At first, they began by selling 48 tons
of anchovies for bait as edible anchovies.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.787
Then they jumped
into the seafood business.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.206
By bidding and fixing the prices,
they won the business license.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.878
Based on that, they became big figures
in the domestic seafood business.

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:28.089
Ha Jung-ho inherited the business
from his parents.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:31.634
He's currently in charge of 32.9%
of seafood distribution in the country.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.428
Wow, he's rich.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.471
That's not all.

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:38.349
You know Haha Jungho Sushi
that's popular among Gen Z

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:41.978
and Ha Jung-ho Raw Fish Restaurant,
which older generations go to?

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.646
They all belong to him,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.316
which means he's the CEO
of the latest trendy franchises.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.986
Wait. But even after hearing all this,
it doesn't sound like he did anything bad.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:53.281
I mean, you can't blame the kid
for what his parents did.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.699
You know the saying that goes…

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.160
-Two peas in a pod!
-Not that one.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.828
Blood is thicker than water?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.705
I knew it.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.166
It's only normal for him
to have a bigger flaw.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:08.254
That's right. Ha Jung-ho inherited
the scammer's DNA from his parents.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:13.009
He doesn't just relabel imported
or farmed products as domestic and wild.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:17.388
Remember oilfish, the one banned
from consumption since 2012?

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:21.559
He's been raking in huge profits
by mixing that into tuna belly

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.520
and grilled toothfish.

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.481
Yi-rang, I have to say you're amazing.

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.400
How do you find such a piece of garbage
every time?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.361
Well…

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.989
Remember I went to watch a movie
the other day?

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:39.494
I saw a drunk man
who was ripping paper into pieces

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:43.122
and throwing it into a trash can.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.083
And?

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.418
I was so curious about what was going on.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.505
Why were you curious?

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:51.923
Of course you get curious.

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:54.175
Hey, it could've been a love letter

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.470
or a chain letter from England, you know?

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:58.555
So, what was it?

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:02.350
A will.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.019
What? A will?

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:18.950
Where do you think he put that painting?

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.537
It's clearly not in his office.

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.373
Mr. Ray-Bang released his boys
to search every corner.

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:30.753
There must be a secret space.
Where could that be?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:39.512
We need that painting
to lure the culprit according to our plan.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:40.763
I know.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:42.557
Mr. Ha.

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.059
I'm begging you.

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:49.063
Mr. Oh.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:52.025
You're putting me in a tough spot.

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.111
Mr. Ha.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:58.907
-No one knows me better than you do.
-Right.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.867
Can you give me one more chance?

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.036
I'll make sure this never happens again--

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:06.998
I mean, how can I ignore that incident

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:09.459
when the news spread all over the country?

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.044
Get up now.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:16.174
Then can you take over my factory?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:21.512
Can you at least help my employees?
I'm begging you.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.514
Leave first.

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:25.683
For goodness' sake, leave for now.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:35.818
He must be in shock. He looks unstable.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.072
Is that how he looks to you too?

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.532
Something doesn't feel right.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:42.909
Should we follow him?

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:44.369
Should we?

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.085
YOUR MOVIE

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:36.587
WHERE YOU ARE THE LEAD

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.844
A WONDERFUL HAPPY ENDING

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.513
IS WAITING FOR YOU

00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:46.764
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU

00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:12.248
I'm glad he's just leaving.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:16.002
Anyway, who thought of installing
those phrases there?

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.546
Whoever it was
deserves the Nobel Prize… Hey.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:19.922
Where are you going?

00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.007
Wait, hey…

00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:27.263
What's she doing?

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.933
Why's she picking that up?

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:34.479
Did you tape it all together?

00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:36.564
So, this is the will you mentioned?

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:37.565
Yes.

00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:39.192
Remember how an entire elementary school

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:40.943
was sent to the hospital recently
after lunch?

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:42.028
Yes.

00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:44.489
Does Ha Jung-ho have anything
to do with that?

00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:48.785
With politicians on his back,

00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:54.540
he skillfully manipulated the media
and put the blame on his subcontractors.

00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:59.045
So, without any restrictions or penalties,
he was able to escape,

00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:02.548
and only the innocent factory owners
had to shut down their factories.

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.134
That's insane…

00:23:05.635 --> 00:23:06.469
Wait.

00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:09.430
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:10.431
Wait…

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:12.016
Oilfish.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.392
-Hey. Wait.
-What the…

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:14.602
It's coming out. Let me go.

00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:17.480
Have you been working out? Your muscles…

00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:25.655
CEO HA JUNG-HO
DEPOSITED 30,000,000 WON

00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:29.534
Why did you send so much?

00:23:29.617 --> 00:23:32.120
I thought you'd need some money
to make ends meet for now.

00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:38.793
I'll never forget your kindness.

00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:41.087
Cheer up.

00:23:48.553 --> 00:23:49.929
I'm sorry.

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:51.514
Don't say that.

00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:53.724
You've been working so hard until now.

00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:55.852
You did your best, sir.

00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:59.397
There must be jobs for us in this country.

00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:04.402
This makes me so sad.

00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:07.363
Sir, cheer up.

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:08.281
Sir.

00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:12.535
How can someone so old be that naive?

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:15.246
He is downright pathetic.

00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:27.008
Secretary Choi,
Mr. Oh's factory will be on auction soon.

00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:28.509
Take that over immediately,

00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:32.763
and place all the factory items
we purchased back where they were.

00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:42.106
Why would I pay in full
to take over a factory

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.692
with old and intractable employees?

00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:53.242
So, how do you plan to teach
that oilfish man a lesson?

00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:54.327
-That's…
-Hold on.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.998
Gosh, this oilfish is serious.

00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:00.458
Toilet paper!

00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:04.253
Are you going again?

00:25:05.379 --> 00:25:07.215
Gosh, it's serious.

00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:15.973
I have this operation planned out.

00:25:16.057 --> 00:25:18.684
Gu-ho, you'll become a mailman

00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:21.229
and switch Ha Jung-ho's movie magazine
to the one that we made.

00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:24.941
Ha Jung-ho is a serious movie fanatic.

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:29.403
He's so extreme
that he watches every new movie.

00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:35.159
Well, thanks to his con parents,
Ha Jung-ho was born rich.

00:25:35.243 --> 00:25:37.370
So, in college,
he dreamed of becoming an actor

00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:41.791
by directing and starring
in the movie he wrote.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.378
He was into Hong Kong gangster movies
at the time,

00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:47.463
so he wrote
about a young and handsome gangster

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:52.468
who wanted to change the world
back in the '60s.

00:25:54.095 --> 00:25:55.638
-Boss!
-Boss!

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.354
Look here, thug!

00:26:06.774 --> 00:26:09.402
How about a one-on-one fight with me?

00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:12.697
Everyone who watched it
said it was childish,

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.116
but Ha Jung-ho was serious.

00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:17.243
Although no one recognized it,

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:20.746
it was like a suppressed message
from deep within his heart.

00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:26.043
Perhaps his obsession with cinema
was his only escape.

00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:28.671
Was that movie even released?

00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:30.423
I've never seen that before.

00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.174
There was no way it was released.

00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:33.968
It was just for his own use.

00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:38.097
He lived his life just as a business heir.

00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:40.182
But he was in the spotlight

00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:43.394
when he was pouring his passion
onto the screen.

00:26:46.272 --> 00:26:47.523
Oh, so handsome.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.360
Jeez, I don't even need to see it.

00:26:51.444 --> 00:26:54.071
I bet it wasn't even B-list
but a lame piece of garbage.

00:26:54.155 --> 00:26:57.283
It's obvious
since he has the scammer's DNA in him.

00:26:57.366 --> 00:27:00.703
It was probably a ridiculous story
plagiarized from here and there.

00:27:01.704 --> 00:27:02.705
You got it.

00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:05.875
He probably didn't know
that it would be his last movie either.

00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:07.043
Boss!

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.713
-Boss.
-Go help him!

00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:12.173
Boss, are you okay?

00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:13.841
Let me go. Don't touch me.

00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:16.427
Justice prevails.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.770
When he wanted to go study film in the US,

00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:28.564
due to his father's
unexpected health issues,

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.274
he had to take over the family business.

00:27:30.358 --> 00:27:35.988
Cinema is an unfulfilled dream
for Ha Jung-ho.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:40.868
"Weekly Cinema."

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.918

there's the Café Soran-Soran

00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.134
Café Soran-Soran?

00:27:58.219 --> 00:27:59.637
I've never heard of it before.

00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.686
FISHERIES DISTRIBUTION
CEO HA JUNG-HO

00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:16.737

"If Paris, France, has Les Deux Magots,

there's the Café Soran-Soran

CAFÉ SORAN-SORAN

00:28:45.683 --> 00:28:48.269
THE OPERATION BEGINS

00:28:53.441 --> 00:28:54.859
Thirty seconds before arriving.

00:29:08.497 --> 00:29:09.498
He's going down now.

00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:12.293
Director Kang, are you ready?

00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:13.210
Yes.

00:29:13.836 --> 00:29:14.837
Good luck.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.505
-Thanks for your cooperation.
-Five.

00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:21.719
Four, three, two, one.

00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:23.929
Madam Kim, that was good.

00:29:24.013 --> 00:29:26.056
Thank you. Bye, Director Kang.

00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:32.980
Director Kang, how are you?

00:29:33.063 --> 00:29:35.232
-Hey, Kang-min.
-Hello, Director Kang.

00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:37.485
-Let's talk outside.
-Are you working on a movie?

00:29:37.568 --> 00:29:39.320
I'm doing my best.

00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:40.571
Hello.

00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:44.450
Was that Director Kang Yun-sung
of The Outlaws and Big Bet?

00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:46.869
That is Director Kang.

00:29:48.287 --> 00:29:50.706
Is this your first time at our cafe?

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.751
Yes. I read about it in the magazine.

00:29:54.335 --> 00:29:56.086
Oh, that magazine!

00:29:57.171 --> 00:29:59.757
Hold on. What should I drink?

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.050
Well…

00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:04.803
How about Director Kang's usual?

00:30:05.763 --> 00:30:07.306
The Director Kang who just left?

00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:08.849
Yes! I'll have that.

00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:13.229
-One moment, please.
-Hey, Hwa-ryeon. We're here.

00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:15.147
Hi, you're late.

00:30:15.231 --> 00:30:17.858
-There was a problem on set.
-I see.

00:30:17.942 --> 00:30:19.693
-The usual.
-Sure.

00:30:19.777 --> 00:30:21.695
-Make that two.
-Okay.

00:30:22.488 --> 00:30:23.697
Make that two.

00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:25.824
-Director Kim.
-Yes.

00:30:25.908 --> 00:30:27.868
I want to compress this scene.

00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:31.956
But Mr. Lee, the climax
will be too boring without this scene.

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:33.749
Why are you so extreme?

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.961
I'm not saying we should get rid of it
but just keep it simple.

00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:39.171
Is it about the budget again?

00:30:39.255 --> 00:30:40.548
You know we have no other choice.

00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:44.218
We should make concessions
considering the situation.

00:30:45.803 --> 00:30:47.096
I'll think about it.

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:49.807
Yes. Thank you.
But we can keep this part in return.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.100
Excuse me.

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:54.270
Do you know
Dragon King Production by any chance?

00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:55.479
Yes.

00:30:55.563 --> 00:30:59.984
He's the CEO,
and that is a rookie director.

00:31:03.237 --> 00:31:05.322
But things aren't looking pretty lately.

00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:08.534
What about the cast?

00:31:08.617 --> 00:31:11.829
It's a female-led movie,
so Kim Da-eun will do it for sure.

00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:14.206
But Hyeon-u is the problem.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.793
He thinks he was born a celeb.
That brat is being so arrogant.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:19.253
Forget about Hyeon-u.

00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:23.132
If Kim Da-eun said she'd do it,
any actor would be willing to do it.

00:31:23.716 --> 00:31:24.967
No need to worry about that, but…

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.552
But? What else is the problem?

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:32.349
The role of the thug
who devotes his life to the female lead.

00:31:32.433 --> 00:31:36.145
Oh, you mean the short but intense role.

00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:38.439
-That's a good one. You know it.
-Yes. It's awesome.

00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:39.690
A thug?

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.068
Is it a gangster movie?

00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:46.530
He doesn't have to be good at acting,
but I want it to be someone with the look.

00:31:46.614 --> 00:31:48.449
Oh, that's possible.

00:31:48.532 --> 00:31:51.160
We can reduce the lines
and focus on the look.

00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:52.286
Don't worry about that.

00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:54.872
Just name it. I'll bring him to you now.

00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:57.916
In a way, that role is my persona.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.668
Okay. Don't worry.

00:31:59.752 --> 00:32:01.795
What about Nam Gi-hun from Macho Man?

00:32:01.879 --> 00:32:03.964
A thug who sacrifices his life.

00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:07.885
The director's persona? Wow.

00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:09.803
Thanks for the drink.

00:32:09.887 --> 00:32:11.430
Hey, Hwa-ryeon. We're leaving.

00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:15.768
James, this target looks too easy.

00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.187
I know. This will totally end in no time.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.772
How about chicken feet with soju?

00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:21.482
Hagfish with somaek on top of that?

00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:22.733
-You got me.
-Yeah.

00:32:25.778 --> 00:32:27.613
-Did you leave the script behind?
-Of course.

00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:28.530
Okay.

00:33:00.354 --> 00:33:01.689
MADAM GANGSTER
CONFIDENTIAL

00:33:03.232 --> 00:33:07.778
"In 1962, gangs ran wild
around Jongno and Euljiro."

00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:13.283
"But there was one woman who could
take them all down with her bare fists."

00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:16.161
"They called her Madam Gangster."

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.040
It was about a heroine?

00:33:20.624 --> 00:33:21.542
Impressive.

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.419
It's probably here. Don't worry.

00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:25.003
Man, seriously.

00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:26.839
You saw it earlier.

00:33:28.257 --> 00:33:29.758
It should be here…

00:33:29.842 --> 00:33:32.219
You should've taken care of it!
What if someone reads it?

00:33:32.302 --> 00:33:34.847
We talked while looking at the script.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.016
Mr. Lee, if anyone plagiarizes it,
I won't let that slide.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.310
Then we'll totally sue them!

00:33:40.394 --> 00:33:43.105
-We'll sue them.
-Plagiarize? Sue?

00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:45.399
Excuse me.

00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:47.693
What?

00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:56.660
It was on the ground, so I picked it up.

00:33:56.744 --> 00:33:59.246
Thank you so much.

00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:01.331
Gosh, that was close.

00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:02.249
Excuse me.

00:34:03.292 --> 00:34:05.627
By any chance, did you read it?

00:34:06.462 --> 00:34:07.963
No. Why would I read it?

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:09.214
Can I take your word for it?

00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:11.508
Come on. I'm sure he didn't.
It's not even his.

00:34:11.592 --> 00:34:14.762
-Unless he's gone crazy.
-Only a little bit of the beginning.

00:34:15.846 --> 00:34:16.847
Did you read it?

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.724
I only read the beginning slightly.

00:34:18.807 --> 00:34:20.559
He read it!

00:34:20.642 --> 00:34:22.019
I'm sorry. My bad.

00:34:22.102 --> 00:34:25.564
If you read it, you read it.
What do you mean by "slightly"?

00:34:25.647 --> 00:34:27.191
You… Wait.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.943
-We've met before.
-What?

00:34:30.027 --> 00:34:31.195
You look familiar.

00:34:31.278 --> 00:34:32.529
What?

00:34:32.613 --> 00:34:37.326
-Are you from the film industry?
-No, I'm not from that industry.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:38.911
-Then?
-Right. Here.

00:34:40.287 --> 00:34:41.413
My name is Ha Jung-ho.

00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:43.290
Ha Jung-woo?

00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:45.626
You look nothing like him.
How dare you impersonate an actor?

00:34:45.709 --> 00:34:46.710
No, it's Ha Jung-ho.

00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:48.504
"Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution?"

00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:51.089
I remember where I've seen you!

00:34:51.173 --> 00:34:54.176
It's the commercial
where you dance with fish?

00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:57.471
-That Ha Jung-ho!
-CEO Ha Jung-ho.

00:34:57.554 --> 00:34:59.056
Have you seen it?

00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:03.977
Due to my love for movies,
I made a mistake.

00:35:04.061 --> 00:35:06.730
Oh, you should've told me.

00:35:06.814 --> 00:35:10.484
-I'm CEO Lee Seok-jin of Dragon King.
-The CEO.

00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:11.860
And this is a rookie director.

00:35:11.944 --> 00:35:13.946
Hi, I'm Director Kim Hong-pyo.

00:35:15.823 --> 00:35:17.366
-Director Kim Hong-pyo.
-Yes.

00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:18.408
Have a seat first.

00:35:18.492 --> 00:35:19.910
-Oh, sure.
-This way.

00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:22.621
-Have a seat, please.
-Thanks.

00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:24.706
-It's an honor.
-Nice to meet you.

00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:28.335
I didn't know you loved movies.

00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:29.378
Same.

00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:32.464
I'm ashamed to say this,

00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:36.885
but I learned about life from movies.

00:35:36.969 --> 00:35:39.179
Oh, you love it that much?

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.432
People from different times and places

00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:47.938
can share emotions
by watching the same movie.

00:35:48.021 --> 00:35:49.439
Isn't the power of movies amazing?

00:35:50.607 --> 00:35:52.276
Movies are fiction,

00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:56.655
but the emotions of viewers are real.

00:35:57.656 --> 00:36:00.284
Gosh. That's what you're making.

00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:04.663
You two are truly amazing.

00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:05.664
That's philosophical.

00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:07.374
That's how serious he is about movies.

00:36:07.457 --> 00:36:08.375
I know.

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.503
-Mr. Ha.
-Yes.

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.131
Do you want to finish reading it?

00:36:16.258 --> 00:36:17.885
-Me?
-Yes.

00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:20.637
It's something
no one outside the production can read,

00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:23.682
but you could be part of it in the future.

00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:25.475
So, why don't you give it a read?

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:26.768
"Part of it?"

00:36:27.436 --> 00:36:30.063
Since you're a movie lover…

00:36:30.147 --> 00:36:33.525
Are you interested
in investing in our movie?

00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:39.448
Well…

00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:40.908
After reading it.

00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:43.452
Of course.
Please take your time to read it.

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:45.621
Can we have three coffees here?

00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:47.164
-Okay, three coffees.
-No.

00:36:50.042 --> 00:36:51.877
Get us the most expensive liquor
in this place.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.794
My goodness.

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:06.266
This is good.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.101
Once-in-a-decade…

00:37:08.185 --> 00:37:12.564
No, this is
a once-in-50-years masterpiece!

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:16.902
Director Kim here knows
how to write good scripts.

00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.278
Oh, I'm flattered.

00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:24.785
The lead lost her parents before her eyes.

00:37:24.868 --> 00:37:25.953
A FEW WEEKS AGO

00:37:26.078 --> 00:37:28.080
Due to the shock, she lost her memories.

00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:33.877
One day, she sees the tattoo
on a man passing by,

00:37:33.961 --> 00:37:37.714
and all the memories she'd forgotten
suddenly come back to her.

00:37:37.798 --> 00:37:39.675
The tattoo in her memory

00:37:40.467 --> 00:37:43.637
is the symbol of the West Gate Gang.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:50.060
She then begins destroying the
West Gate Gang's businesses one by one.

00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:51.395
Then finally,

00:37:51.478 --> 00:37:57.359
she finds a man who's deeply related
to the death of her parents.

00:37:57.442 --> 00:37:58.527
Here's the twist.

00:37:59.653 --> 00:38:03.407
Her parents weren't actually her parents.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:08.161
And the enemy of her parents

00:38:08.245 --> 00:38:10.247
was actually her stepbrother.

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.374
An older stepbrother.

00:38:12.457 --> 00:38:15.210
Gosh, it couldn't get any worse.

00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:16.753
You know what?

00:38:16.837 --> 00:38:21.508
No movie ever went bad
with memory loss and birth secret trope.

00:38:21.591 --> 00:38:25.387
Still, don't you think
that's too outdated?

00:38:26.054 --> 00:38:27.139
-You think so?
-Yes.

00:38:28.598 --> 00:38:29.725
1972
ALL ABOUT SCENARIO WRITING

00:38:30.183 --> 00:38:32.102
Oh, this was from 1972!

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:34.938
Right? I knew it.

00:38:35.022 --> 00:38:37.190
-That won't do it.
-The latest version.

00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:39.943
There it is. This is the latest edition.

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:42.863
-Hey, delete all that.
-Yes. Delete everything.

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:44.656
We can't use that.

00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:48.035
We'll start from Scene One.

00:38:48.118 --> 00:38:50.579
-Okay. Scene One.
-Scene One.

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:52.497
Here's the evidence.

00:38:52.581 --> 00:38:54.958
Our production cost is 20 billion won.

00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:57.753
And we gathered 16 billion won in no time.

00:38:57.836 --> 00:38:59.129
TOTAL INVESTMENT AMOUNT

00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:00.338
16 BILLION WON

00:39:00.422 --> 00:39:03.508
Now, we're left
with only four billion won.

00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:05.260
Now, what do you say?

00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:08.847
Would you like to start
your first movie with us?

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.474
It's only four billion won.

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:13.018
Mr. Ha.

00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:16.313
If someone like you who truly loves movies
invests in us,

00:39:16.396 --> 00:39:19.191
I will feel huge support.

00:39:19.775 --> 00:39:20.859
Would you like to invest?

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:32.871
A movie like this
is exactly what we need in this era.

00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:34.081
That's right.

00:39:34.164 --> 00:39:35.707
-Yes.
-That's right.

00:39:36.875 --> 00:39:37.709
Invest…

00:39:37.793 --> 00:39:38.752
-Invest.
-Invest.

00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:39.711
Invest…

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.755
Invest!

00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:46.343
How can I?

00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:47.761
That's nonsense.

00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:49.054
Here. Cheers.

00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:54.810
So,

00:39:54.893 --> 00:39:59.314
your father was also a director?

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:00.524
Yes, that's right.

00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:03.443
Well, perhaps it's because of his father,

00:40:04.027 --> 00:40:08.782
but the whole film industry
is expecting a lot from him, you know?

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:10.242
I see.

00:40:11.868 --> 00:40:14.621
Me too. I took over the family business.

00:40:14.704 --> 00:40:18.750
I think I kind of understand how you feel.

00:40:19.876 --> 00:40:22.420
That's right.
And you're a second-generation chaebol.

00:40:22.504 --> 00:40:23.421
A chaebol.

00:40:23.505 --> 00:40:25.215
And I'm a second-generation director.

00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:28.176
We're both second-generations.
We have so much in common.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.761
That's what I mean.

00:40:29.845 --> 00:40:30.971
Maybe we're meant to be.

00:40:31.054 --> 00:40:34.808
We're aiming for our movie
to reach ten million viewers.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.979
-Ten million.
-Ten million.

00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:41.690
Let's make a movie
with ten million viewers together, Mr. Ha!

00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:43.608
Let's do that! Ten million!

00:40:43.692 --> 00:40:44.693
-Ten million!
-Ten million!

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:45.777
-Ten million!
-Ten million!

00:40:45.861 --> 00:40:46.862
-Ten million!
-Ten million!

00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:48.738
-Ten million!
-No way.

00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:53.160
An amateur like me?

00:40:53.243 --> 00:40:56.413
Come on.
I don't want to cause you trouble.

00:40:56.496 --> 00:40:57.497
Come on.

00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:59.833
-Stop joking. Let's drink.
-Let's drink.

00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:02.335
Come on. Ten million sounds impossible.

00:41:07.257 --> 00:41:08.758
Hey, listen.

00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:15.056
-Rather than those investors…
-Yes.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.310
-The ones who are only after money…
-Yes.

00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:24.024
I want a sincere cinema lover like you

00:41:24.107 --> 00:41:28.695
to invest in our movie
and make a big profit.

00:41:29.613 --> 00:41:31.615
-So please!
-Yes!

00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:34.075
-Let's make a movie together, Mr. Ha!
-Let's do it!

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:35.994
This is worth money.

00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:36.995
Yes.

00:41:37.078 --> 00:41:38.330
I'm begging you. Please!

00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:39.748
-Please!
-Please!

00:41:43.293 --> 00:41:45.045
-Please!
-Please!

00:41:45.128 --> 00:41:46.171
No.

00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:48.089
Darn it.

00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:49.007
Never!

00:41:50.884 --> 00:41:53.053
If I invest now…

00:41:53.136 --> 00:41:54.262
Come on.

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:55.597
Think about it. Okay?

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.309
If I invest in your movie now…
I'm not even from this industry.

00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:01.603
It doesn't make any sense. Jeez.

00:42:04.898 --> 00:42:09.319
You know, I take back
what I said about an easy target.

00:42:09.402 --> 00:42:12.489
He looks like he'd fall for it,
but he won't. Damn it.

00:42:12.572 --> 00:42:14.908
Why is he refusing to invest?

00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:16.910
-It's a hassle to curl my hair.
-I'm dying.

00:42:16.993 --> 00:42:18.995
He's a pain in the neck.

00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:20.872
I…

00:42:21.957 --> 00:42:24.334
understand him.

00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:26.127
When did you two get here?

00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:28.964
I called him.
Mr. Mustache used to work in film.

00:42:29.673 --> 00:42:30.715
What's up?

00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:34.052
So? What's his deal?

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:41.935
It's not easy to approach
someone you've respected for so long.

00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:44.145
What's that?

00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:46.231
It's like this.

00:42:51.236 --> 00:42:54.447
The campus queen
you didn't even dare to look at

00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:56.950
suddenly asks you out.

00:42:58.076 --> 00:42:59.995
Then you should be grateful
and go out with her.

00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:01.454
No can do.

00:43:01.538 --> 00:43:03.164
-What do you mean?
-What?

00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:04.666
So, basically,

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:09.421
she's like a noble being from heaven
you can't even touch.

00:43:10.005 --> 00:43:11.923
So you don't dare to approach her.

00:43:12.007 --> 00:43:13.591
Still, that sounds like a loser.

00:43:13.675 --> 00:43:15.927
A loser?
How can you say something so mean?

00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:22.684
That reminds me…

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:26.604
If someone like you who truly loves movies
invests in us,

00:43:26.688 --> 00:43:28.398
I will feel huge support.

00:43:28.481 --> 00:43:29.649
Would you like to invest?

00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:32.736
How can I? That's nonsense.

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:35.572
Let's make a movie
with ten million viewers together, Mr. Ha!

00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:37.490
Let's do that! Ten million!

00:43:37.574 --> 00:43:38.700
No way.

00:43:38.783 --> 00:43:41.786
I want a sincere cinema lover like you
to invest…

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:42.912
No.

00:43:42.996 --> 00:43:44.164
Darn it.

00:43:44.998 --> 00:43:45.832
Never!

00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:49.210
I think I get it now.

00:43:49.294 --> 00:43:52.380
A spoiled brat who has always gotten
everything he's wanted in his whole life

00:43:53.173 --> 00:43:54.799
becomes naive and timid

00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:56.926
before the cinema,

00:43:57.427 --> 00:43:59.054
which he has always admired.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:01.473
So?

00:44:03.516 --> 00:44:06.102
Do you now understand a true film lover?

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:09.481
No, I don't get it.

00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:13.276
But if he's startled
by something unexpected,

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.780
then I plan to have
a little fling with him.

00:44:16.863 --> 00:44:18.615
Then he'll find himself

00:44:18.698 --> 00:44:22.202
signing the contract
even before he knows it.

00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:28.500
Mr. Ha.

00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:31.044
You should come
and watch our first shoot today.

00:44:31.127 --> 00:44:33.421
Are you sure it's a place for me?

00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:36.132
Come on. You're hurting my feelings now.

00:44:36.216 --> 00:44:39.302
You're part of our production, almost.

00:44:44.182 --> 00:44:46.351
-This is where we're filming.
-I see.

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:48.395
Hello, sir.

00:44:48.478 --> 00:44:49.771
Hi, keep up the good work.

00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:50.814
How are you?

00:44:50.897 --> 00:44:52.273
-This way.
-Thanks.

00:44:52.357 --> 00:44:55.402
Another production
is filming on that side.

00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:56.319
This way.

00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:01.658
It's a huge set.

00:45:03.827 --> 00:45:05.745
People on each side and…

00:45:06.287 --> 00:45:07.789
Okay, we'll start.

00:45:29.144 --> 00:45:31.104
Cut. We'll give it a look.

00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:35.233
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:36.693
-Loyalty.
-Loyalty.

00:45:38.528 --> 00:45:40.321
You haven't changed. How's your back?

00:45:40.405 --> 00:45:41.781
My back has gotten better.

00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:42.866
That's a relief.

00:45:44.284 --> 00:45:46.202
You look great, by the way.

00:45:46.286 --> 00:45:48.496
Oh, thank you. I aged a lot.

00:45:49.873 --> 00:45:51.082
I heard the new script was good.

00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:52.834
-Really?
-You should show me.

00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:54.794
Sure. He's the producer of my movie.

00:45:55.545 --> 00:45:57.297
I'm not a producer yet.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.257
-I'm Ha Jung-ho.
-Hello.

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.550
I'm a big fan of yours!

00:46:01.259 --> 00:46:03.178
Why, thank you.

00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:04.929
-Sir, let's check the playback.
-Okay.

00:46:05.013 --> 00:46:06.639
-I'll keep you updated.
-Okay.

00:46:06.723 --> 00:46:07.599
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

00:46:07.682 --> 00:46:08.683
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:11.561
-Kim Bo-sung?
-Yes. You know, "Loyalty!"

00:46:11.644 --> 00:46:12.479
Yes, I know.

00:46:12.562 --> 00:46:13.438
-The action star.
-Yes.

00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:15.064
I'm a huge fan.

00:46:16.024 --> 00:46:17.942
-We have to go this way.
-This way?

00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:21.946
Hello.

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:24.616
Director Kim!

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.203
-Mr. Ha!
-Hi.

00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:30.079
Director Kim.

00:46:30.163 --> 00:46:31.164
You're working hard.

00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:33.124
Thank you for coming all the way here.

00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:34.751
Everyone, say hi.

00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:37.670
Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution's CEO,
Ha Jung-ho.

00:46:37.754 --> 00:46:39.339
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:46:39.422 --> 00:46:40.590
Oh, hello.

00:46:40.673 --> 00:46:44.636
Mr. Ha sent a fishcake truck
for our hardworking staff.

00:46:45.428 --> 00:46:46.387
Give it up for him!

00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:48.014
Fishcake truck!

00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:50.225
-Thank you!
-Thank you, Mr. Ha.

00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:51.601
-No problem.
-This way, please.

00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:52.519
Okay.

00:46:52.602 --> 00:46:54.395
Mr. Ha, take a seat here.

00:46:54.479 --> 00:46:55.313
DIRECTOR

00:46:55.396 --> 00:46:57.440
Oh, how can I…

00:46:57.524 --> 00:46:59.192
Come on. We're not strangers, you know?

00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.443
Have a seat. It's okay.

00:47:00.527 --> 00:47:02.237
Should I, then?

00:47:07.367 --> 00:47:09.702
-Mr. Ha, take your time to look around.
-Sure.

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:12.997
-This is Camera A, and that's Camera B.
-I see.

00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:14.541
-At the end…
-We use two cameras.

00:47:14.624 --> 00:47:16.543
When the door opens,
the female lead comes out.

00:47:16.626 --> 00:47:18.878
And the sun shines over her. Okay.

00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:21.756
-Are the cameras ready?
-Yes, they're ready.

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.675
-Are the lights ready?
-Yes.

00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:25.385
Then we'll begin now.

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.222
Here we go.

00:47:30.098 --> 00:47:31.057
One, two…

00:47:31.724 --> 00:47:35.353
One, two, three.

00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:57.667
Oh no. What the…

00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:00.753
What the heck?

00:48:00.837 --> 00:48:01.671
What happened?

00:48:01.754 --> 00:48:03.089
-Oh no.
-What's going on?

00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:04.674
Is that part of the script?

00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:06.509
No, I don't think so.

00:48:06.593 --> 00:48:07.760
Gosh, this is bad.

00:48:07.844 --> 00:48:08.761
We have a patient!

00:48:08.845 --> 00:48:10.305
-What happened?
-Call an ambulance!

00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:11.347
Ambulance!

00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:13.266
Is she okay?

00:48:14.183 --> 00:48:15.893
What? I don't know.

00:48:16.853 --> 00:48:18.646
Eat up. It's okay.

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:19.981
Yes, enjoy.

00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:22.233
-Thanks for the food.
-Thank you.

00:48:22.317 --> 00:48:24.110
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

00:48:24.193 --> 00:48:25.111
Thank you.

00:48:25.194 --> 00:48:27.113
Let's eat before the fishcakes get soggy.

00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:31.034
By the way, how's the female lead doing?

00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:33.661
Darn it.

00:48:33.745 --> 00:48:35.830
Why? What's wrong?

00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:38.166
I just got a call
from Kim Da-eun's manager.

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:39.167
She's quitting.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.501
She's quitting?

00:48:40.585 --> 00:48:43.171
How come? Is it a health issue?

00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:48.092
-Anemia from pregnancy.
-My goodness.

00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.385
Damn it.

00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:51.095
This is bad.

00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:55.099
All the companies that invested
because of her will want their money back.

00:48:55.892 --> 00:48:57.310
Tell them to take it.

00:48:57.393 --> 00:49:00.021
I don't want money
from companies with crappy attitudes.

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:03.232
But how are you going to film
without that money?

00:49:03.316 --> 00:49:04.233
I don't even know.

00:49:04.317 --> 00:49:05.860
Okay, well…

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.779
We can't postpone it anymore.

00:49:08.363 --> 00:49:09.947
Let's reduce the scale.

00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:11.532
Reduce the scale?

00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:14.702
Are you telling me
to make a rubbish movie then?

00:49:14.786 --> 00:49:16.037
No, that's impossible.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.164
How do you know
if it'll be rubbish or a masterpiece

00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:20.708
-before you try--
-Of course I do! Isn't it obvious?

00:49:20.792 --> 00:49:22.418
Then what are you going to do
without money?

00:49:22.502 --> 00:49:26.214
For goodness' sake!
It's always about money!

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:28.716
Is that all you care about?
I'm freaking sick of it!

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.885
What? Sick of money?

00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:35.098
How are you going to make the movie
without money? What a clueless dude.

00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:37.517
Watch how you speak to the director!

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.435
What did I say wrong?

00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:41.521
Do you want me to call him a jerk then?

00:49:41.604 --> 00:49:44.315
-Calm down.
-What a nut.

00:49:44.399 --> 00:49:45.858
-Hey!
-Calm down.

00:49:45.942 --> 00:49:47.485
Come on. Please calm down!

00:49:47.568 --> 00:49:48.403
That freaking…

00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:51.197
The script is good.
You'll get more investors soon.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.740
What are you saying?

00:49:52.824 --> 00:49:55.576
Who's going to invest in a movie
without a female lead?

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.079
-Would you do that?
-That's what I mean.

00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:00.248
Would you invest in it? Would you?

00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:01.999
Would you invest in the movie?

00:50:02.083 --> 00:50:03.459
Would you take that risk?

00:50:03.543 --> 00:50:05.795
-Would you do it then?
-Answer me.

00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:07.505
-Would you do it yourself?
-Would you?

00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:09.799
All right. Fine.

00:50:11.134 --> 00:50:12.468
Well, how much do you need?

00:50:12.552 --> 00:50:14.512
How many times did I tell you?
Just four billion won!

00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:17.098
It's just four billion!
Wouldn't you want to invest?

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:19.183
Will you do it? It's only four billion!

00:50:19.267 --> 00:50:21.018
Answer us already! Would you invest?

00:50:21.102 --> 00:50:23.938
-Would you?
-It's only four billion!

00:50:25.398 --> 00:50:26.899
-I…
-What?

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:37.285
How can I invest? That's ridiculous.

00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:39.662
I give up! I'm not doing this!

00:50:39.746 --> 00:50:42.039
Hey, let's wrap up!

00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:44.500
Hey, clean it up! Take the equipment!

00:50:44.584 --> 00:50:45.585
What?

00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:48.337
Wait, what's going on?

00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:52.258
Seriously, why is he hesitating so much?

00:50:52.967 --> 00:50:55.595
He looks like he almost fell for it,
but he just won't do it.

00:50:55.678 --> 00:50:57.013
It's driving me insane.

00:50:57.555 --> 00:50:58.931
Exactly.

00:50:59.015 --> 00:51:02.560
Still, casting that major actor
was a good strategy.

00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:06.189
Thank you so much for your help, sir.
I know you're busy.

00:51:06.272 --> 00:51:09.567
No matter how busy I am,
if it were for you, I'd do it.

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:12.320
I knew you were loyal.

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:13.237
Oh, right.

00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:16.073
It's not much, but please accept it.

00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:26.292
It wasn't even that difficult.
Why so much?

00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:29.796
What do you mean?
It's far from your name value.

00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:33.424
Well, if you need me again,
don't hesitate to call me.

00:51:33.508 --> 00:51:34.634
I'm free these days.

00:51:34.717 --> 00:51:37.094
I don't dare to bother
a great actor like you.

00:51:37.178 --> 00:51:38.638
Once is enough for me.

00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:39.806
No.

00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:42.099
I'm not busy at all. Make sure to call me.

00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:44.852
Oh, no, sir. Thank you for saying that.

00:51:44.936 --> 00:51:46.020
I'm busy. I should get going.

00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:47.855
-Mr. Mustache.
-Yes?

00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:49.857
Call me.

00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:52.109
I've been struggling lately.

00:51:52.193 --> 00:51:57.031
I don't even need a line.
I could be a passerby in the back, okay?

00:51:57.114 --> 00:51:58.783
You know me. Loyalty!

00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:00.076
Loyalty!

00:52:00.159 --> 00:52:01.661
I'll see you later, sir.

00:52:02.495 --> 00:52:04.497
He's done his job. Seriously, I'm busy.

00:52:08.793 --> 00:52:10.920
That man's really loyal.

00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:14.215
When a junior asked, he didn't
even look at the script or check the pay.

00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:16.092
He said okay right away.

00:52:16.175 --> 00:52:21.973
But what's the point? Our target
ripped off his trap and left cheerfully.

00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:23.808
Come on. You know there's a saying.

00:52:23.891 --> 00:52:26.102
"You get stabbed
by the axe that you trust."

00:52:26.185 --> 00:52:27.937
What about that proverb?

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.065
If it didn't work at once,
you can try it two, three, four times.

00:52:31.858 --> 00:52:33.693
You're clueless.

00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:37.196
That's not the proverb you want to say.
It's "Every tree falls after ten chops."

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.948
Well, it's all the same.

00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:40.867
How can the two be the same?

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.288
Yi-rang, you're not thinking about
playing the badger game, are you?

00:52:45.371 --> 00:52:46.873
Wait. No.

00:52:46.956 --> 00:52:49.166
-No, please say you're not.
-I'm pretty.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:51.252
I'm so pretty. Hello, everyone.

00:52:51.878 --> 00:52:56.716
Listen. Ha Jung-ho got divorced twice.

00:52:56.799 --> 00:53:00.636
-So? Do you think I could seduce him?
-No, don't take advantage of him.

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.722
-Don't do anything.
-Should I make it shorter?

00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:04.223
-I don't want to see that.
-Don't.

00:53:04.307 --> 00:53:06.642
-Like this. Here.
-Don't. Hey!

00:53:06.726 --> 00:53:07.643
No.

00:53:07.727 --> 00:53:09.228
Nice. Very good.

00:53:09.312 --> 00:53:10.438
No, don't do it.

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:12.273
-Nice.
-No, stop it.

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:14.150
-No. Stop it.
-All right.

00:53:15.318 --> 00:53:16.652
Do I look good?

00:53:16.736 --> 00:53:18.195
Don't do that. That's wrong.

00:53:18.279 --> 00:53:20.197
Not the badger game, no.

00:53:20.281 --> 00:53:21.949
-Please stop.
-This is wrong.

00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:32.168
THE GODDESS OF THE MAINLAND
ACTOR MARY YOO

00:53:32.251 --> 00:53:33.669
Mary Yoo?

00:53:33.753 --> 00:53:35.296
I've never heard of that name before.

00:53:35.379 --> 00:53:38.257
"Mary Yoo
is not that well-known in Korea."

00:53:38.341 --> 00:53:40.551
"Influenced by her father
of Hong Kong nationality,

00:53:40.635 --> 00:53:43.387
she first debuted in China
and became a Chinese goddess."

00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:47.099
"She's currently looking for her first…"

00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:52.563
"She's looking for her first movie?"

00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:01.030
Oh, it's him.

00:54:01.113 --> 00:54:02.031
It's him.

00:54:04.784 --> 00:54:05.701
Yes, Mr. Ha.

00:54:05.785 --> 00:54:07.161
Director Kim,

00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:10.539
have you decided on the female lead yet?

00:54:10.623 --> 00:54:13.584
Not yet.
I'm busy because of that right now.

00:54:13.668 --> 00:54:16.712
Really? Then for the female lead--

00:54:16.796 --> 00:54:18.005
Sorry, I'll call you back.

00:54:18.089 --> 00:54:18.965
Hello?

00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:20.800
Hello?

00:54:26.764 --> 00:54:31.185
FROM THE GODDESS OF MAINLAND
TO A STAR IN KOREA!

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.698
Fine. Then we'll play the game you want.

00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:45.866
What do you want to play?

00:54:51.706 --> 00:54:54.208
It's too cruel to call it a game.

00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:58.337
Because the utopia that you dream of…

00:55:03.009 --> 00:55:05.344
I'll turn that into complete hell.

00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:46.218
She was different
from the moment I first saw her.

00:55:46.302 --> 00:55:50.306
A baby who just took his first step
into the film industry is excited.

00:55:50.389 --> 00:55:52.224
Bravo! That's impressive!

00:55:52.308 --> 00:55:53.517
We should play along.

00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:54.894
Here we go.

00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:56.103
Action!

00:55:56.187 --> 00:55:57.938
Where did he put that painting?

00:55:58.022 --> 00:56:00.441
There was nothing unusual
in Ha Jung-ho's movement.

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:03.277
Like the night of a full moon?

00:56:03.903 --> 00:56:05.613
There's something between the two.

00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:07.031
A painting like that…

00:56:08.866 --> 00:56:12.286
If you don't want to die,
tell me where you hid it.
