00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.890
I thought about it.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.590
The situation here changes by the second.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:32.610
We're on the front line.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.020
We must make

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.800
the best decisions in the shortest time.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.530
If there are any consequences,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.250
I'll take full responsibility.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.280
[Grocery Store]

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:43.230
[Convenience Store]

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:12.190
Target in sight.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.070
Everyone on standby

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:13.920
Target in sight.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.730
Everyone on standby.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:15.430
Copy that.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.480
Jiamin.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.330
Haipeng.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.760
How are you doing?

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.550
I'm alright.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:30.330
You call this alright?

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.790
Your foot is so swollen.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.480
I had a sprain. I'm alright.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.810
Where else are you hurt?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.190
Your arm is injured too.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.800
No.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.960
Isn't there police guarding the hospital?

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.020
How did you escape?

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800
Are you stupid?

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.620
She already told you on the phone.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.400
She jumped from the window.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.760
The doctor said

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.360
my condition wasn't stable,

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.230
so they lowered their guard.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.030
How's your foot?

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.590
Do you have any medicine?

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.150
No.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.340
I'll go buy some medicine.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.210
Peng, you should go too.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.700
Sen, what are you up to now?

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.170
Brother,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.230
I want to talk to him alone.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:24.780
Duozai.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.930
Duozai.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.340
Let's go.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.920
Haipeng.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.720
It's your first time at our place.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.120
Next time you come,

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.130
I'll cook seafood for you,

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.440
and we'll have a few more drinks.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.150
OK.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.760
There are too many cops around lately.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.480
They're watching us too closely.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.680
Be careful yourself.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.290
Where's the pharmacy?

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:57.120
It's over there,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.880
at the second intersection.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:00.070
Well,

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.920
you go get the medicine first.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.590
I see a convenience store here.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.290
I'll buy some snacks for Ms. Mai.
