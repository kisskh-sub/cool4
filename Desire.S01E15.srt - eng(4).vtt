00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.600
(Episode 15)

00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:44.909
I'm sorry, no.

00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:47.045
How did no one take photos?

00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:48.312
Gao Tu.

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:50.181
When did you become so stingy?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.022
Stop ignoring me, Gao Tu.

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:04.696
Why guard an Omega so fiercely?

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:40.031
Why guard an Omega so fiercely?

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:51.076
Hey, answer me.

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:52.844
Are you asleep?

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.318
Hey.

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:01.618
Answer me.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.254
Are you asleep?

00:03:10.528 --> 00:03:11.763
No.

00:03:12.497 --> 00:03:15.266
Shen Wenlang, actually I...

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:22.774
Fine, sleep.

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:24.843
Reply first thing tomorrow.

00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:27.412
Good night!

00:03:34.352 --> 00:03:35.520
Fine, sleep.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.856
Reply first thing tomorrow.

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.511
Shen Wenlang knows it very well.

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:01.846
Gao Tu quit.

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:05.950
He's no longer obligated
to reply to Wenlang instantly.

00:04:06.618 --> 00:04:08.920
But having to face the
total lack of motivated communication,

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:16.161
Wenlang, accustomed to instant replies from
Gao Tu still feels rage and disappointment.

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.865
He knew he was being irrational

00:04:21.432 --> 00:04:23.901
but the idea of Gao Tu
with a pregnant Omega

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:25.403
leaving him

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:27.906
felt like a weight on his chest;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.874
suffocating.

00:04:31.543 --> 00:04:34.245
The thought of not seeing Gao Tu daily

00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:36.514
left Wenlang breathless.

00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:40.051
Suffocating like never before.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.151
He should be up by now.

00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:18.323
Why no reply?

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:27.198
Why don't you reply?

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:11.127
If you're not responding,
I'll never contact you again.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.411
We're done.

00:06:13.544 --> 00:06:14.646
Who cares.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.062
[Wenlang recalls/takes
back all his crash-out messages]

00:06:53.918 --> 00:06:56.321
Gao Tu, where's the money you owe me?

00:06:56.688 --> 00:06:58.189
You promised to repay me.

00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:59.624
Where is it?

00:07:12.403 --> 00:07:13.438
Gao Tu.

00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.940
You wouldn't break your word, would you?

00:08:02.896 --> 00:08:05.771
[text notification that Gao Tu
returned the money and that he's broke]

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:28.278
You think if you ignore my calls you
can get away from your responsibility?

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:29.479
I'm your father

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.581
100,000, not a cent less.

00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:32.983
If I'd suffer

00:08:32.984 --> 00:08:34.719
you and Qing will pay.

00:08:34.952 --> 00:08:36.453
My patience is limited.

00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:37.955
Don't test me.

00:09:22.488 --> 00:09:25.503
[text notification saying Wenlang received
the money and that he's obscenely wealthy]

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:37.215
This repayment notice makes
Wenlang's anger rise but not boil over.

00:09:37.615 --> 00:09:40.350
Like a damp firework.

00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:42.253
But no explosion.

00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:45.089
Just fizzling out.

00:09:45.823 --> 00:09:48.392
Instead, a hollow ache

00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:51.529
gnawing emptiness.

00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:06.077
Mr. Hua.

00:10:06.078 --> 00:10:08.078
Your pheromone glands are badly injured.

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:09.145
You need to lie down

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:10.548
Mr. Sheng will wake up soon.

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:11.582
Don't worry.

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:12.716
Go rest in your room.

00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:13.751
Leave.

00:10:14.218 --> 00:10:15.253
I'm staying.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.855
Just add a bed next to Mr. Sheng's.

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:19.323
But.

00:10:19.323 --> 00:10:20.323
But what?

00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:23.027
We must examine the wound.

00:10:23.494 --> 00:10:24.362
Theoretically.

00:10:24.363 --> 00:10:25.996
You need to undergo
surgery as soon as possible.

00:10:25.997 --> 00:10:26.631
Otherwise...

00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:27.631
No need.

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:30.868
Why isn't he awake yet?

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:33.804
Are you sure the test results are okay?

00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:34.871
Yes.

00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:41.845
Mr. Sheng.

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:43.281
You're awake.

00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:51.923
What's wrong with you?

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.392
I'm fine. Take your time.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:57.527
If you get up too quickly, it'll be
bad for your cardiovascular health.

00:10:57.528 --> 00:10:58.796
How did this happen?

00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:02.265
Where's Sheng Shaoqing?

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:04.201
He's been taken to the police.

00:11:04.669 --> 00:11:06.971
Your police are impressively efficient.

00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:08.844
It's a great lesson for
our country to learn from.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.679
Was it Shaoqing?

00:11:15.313 --> 00:11:16.313
Hmm.

00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:18.407
But I'm fine.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.051
But you.

00:11:20.484 --> 00:11:22.887
Shaoqing poisoned the wine.

00:11:23.598 --> 00:11:25.022
The blood test report is pending

00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:26.189
I'm concerned.

00:11:26.424 --> 00:11:28.391
Your glands are damaged

00:11:28.392 --> 00:11:29.794
yet you worry about me?

00:11:30.528 --> 00:11:31.528
Hua Yong.

00:11:31.662 --> 00:11:33.164
Do you live at the hospital?

00:11:33.297 --> 00:11:35.177
You don't get tired of being
hospitalized every day?

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:38.636
Now you're getting me involved.

00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:40.671
Wenlang, stop talking.

00:11:41.272 --> 00:11:44.375
Whether Hua Yong is staying at
the hospital, or who he's visiting...

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:46.277
What does it matter to you?

00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:47.611
Shen Wenlang.

00:11:47.612 --> 00:11:49.547
You haven't gotten enough beatings yet.

00:11:49.914 --> 00:11:51.648
You came to my room to get your ass kicked.

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:53.360
It's a good idea to save
them on the spot, isn't it?

00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:55.385
If it wasn't for this nutcase
standing next to you.

00:11:55.386 --> 00:11:57.454
You think you can take advantage of me?

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:58.455
Oh.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.092
Well, you can come over here and try.

00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:02.093
Wenlang.

00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:04.428
Don't talk to Mr. Sheng in that tone.

00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:05.662
He won't be happy.

00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:09.065
And I'm supposed to be happy if
he's using that tone of voice on me?

00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:10.334
Mr. Sheng.

00:12:10.335 --> 00:12:12.202
Something happened to
Wenlang's family recently.

00:12:12.203 --> 00:12:13.503
He's not in a good mood.

00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:14.839
Don't get on his bad side.

00:12:15.172 --> 00:12:16.172
Something happened?

00:12:16.607 --> 00:12:17.842
What could happen to me?

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:19.409
Secretary Gao resigned

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.244
isn't this an internal crisis for you?

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:21.679
You…

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.180
All right, stop it.

00:12:28.052 --> 00:12:29.186
What the hell is going on?

00:12:29.854 --> 00:12:31.389
How did you get the blood on you?

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.390
Mr. Sheng.

00:12:34.576 --> 00:12:36.945
Sheng Shaoqing poisoned your wine.

00:12:37.228 --> 00:12:39.530
Trying to harm your glands
while you're passed out

00:12:39.663 --> 00:12:41.932
I've handed over the
video evidence to the police.

00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:43.567
The police also confirmed.

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:46.070
Sheng Shaoqing authorized the kidnapping.

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:49.607
Your brother

00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:52.575
is not too well.

00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:55.846
But it's okay.

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:57.313
Luckily.

00:12:58.015 --> 00:13:01.585
It's a good thing the drugs
he gave weren't too strong.

00:13:04.055 --> 00:13:04.688
Hua Yong.

00:13:04.755 --> 00:13:05.456
What's going on?

00:13:05.623 --> 00:13:06.557
Are you okay?

00:13:06.624 --> 00:13:06.957
Yong.

00:13:06.957 --> 00:13:07.425
Boss.

00:13:07.425 --> 00:13:08.425
Yong.

00:13:08.893 --> 00:13:09.493
Doctor.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.860
Doctor.

00:13:13.464 --> 00:13:14.831
I think it's hemorrhagic shock.

00:13:14.832 --> 00:13:15.766
We need to save him now.

00:13:15.766 --> 00:13:16.434
Emergency blood transfusion required.

00:13:16.434 --> 00:13:17.401
What's his blood type?

00:13:17.402 --> 00:13:18.836
He's an S-class Alpha like me

00:13:19.003 --> 00:13:19.970
I think it's type A.

00:13:19.971 --> 00:13:21.638
Okay, I'll call the blood bank and
get a transfusion ready right away.

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:22.639
Wait a minute, Doctor.

00:13:23.174 --> 00:13:23.741
My boss

00:13:24.108 --> 00:13:25.108
is not Alpha blood type.

00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:26.277
So what's his blood type?

00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:28.611
My boss has a very rare blood type.

00:13:28.612 --> 00:13:29.280
You tell me.

00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:30.481
What's his blood type?

00:13:33.317 --> 00:13:34.317
The boss is...

00:13:34.585 --> 00:13:35.585
Enigma.

00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:37.087
Enigma blood type.

00:13:39.957 --> 00:13:41.391
Qing is recovering well.

00:13:41.392 --> 00:13:42.725
She'll be out in a few days.

00:13:42.726 --> 00:13:44.094
Thank you for taking care of me, sis.

00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:44.528
Thank you.

00:13:44.528 --> 00:13:45.528
No worries.

00:13:51.368 --> 00:13:52.002
Brother.

00:13:52.336 --> 00:13:53.871
Are you not feeling well?

00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:55.406
You don't look so good.

00:13:56.207 --> 00:13:57.207
No.

00:13:58.309 --> 00:13:59.210
Then.

00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:00.544
Did something happen?

00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:08.052
Did Gao Ming call you again?

00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:09.487
Don't get so excited.

00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:11.296
Pay attention to your wounds.

00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:13.022
Why does he keep coming back?

00:14:13.023 --> 00:14:14.023
He only cares about your money

00:14:14.024 --> 00:14:15.504
just badgering you over and over.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.230
I'm the same

00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:22.600
I've been sick for so long.

00:14:23.234 --> 00:14:25.836
You've had to take on
both parental roles for me.

00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:28.405
And worried about the
cost of my surgery.

00:14:29.673 --> 00:14:30.840
I wish I wasn't born.

00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:31.841
Stop talking nonsense.

00:14:33.244 --> 00:14:34.244
Don't worry

00:14:34.645 --> 00:14:36.247
I'll never give him money again.

00:14:36.547 --> 00:14:37.715
He can't keep weighing me down.

00:14:38.775 --> 00:14:40.543
I'm happy to take care of you.

00:14:41.292 --> 00:14:42.493
so stop calling it a burden.

00:14:43.788 --> 00:14:44.421
So.

00:14:44.422 --> 00:14:45.623
What's wrong with you?

00:14:46.157 --> 00:14:48.425
I've noticed you've been
absent-minded these days.

00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:54.832
I quit my job.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.434
You scared me

00:14:57.601 --> 00:14:59.303
I thought something terrible was going on.

00:14:59.503 --> 00:15:00.905
So what if you quit?

00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:02.072
I told you.

00:15:02.073 --> 00:15:03.774
That Shen Wenlang is a miserly exploiter.

00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:05.441
But I'm better now

00:15:05.442 --> 00:15:06.509
I can be discharged soon

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.411
I can make money too.

00:15:07.411 --> 00:15:08.411
Qing.

00:15:15.152 --> 00:15:16.287
I'm pregnant.

00:15:23.928 --> 00:15:24.929
What did the doctor say?

00:15:26.597 --> 00:15:27.597
Excessive blood loss.

00:15:27.598 --> 00:15:28.598
Still in a coma.

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:31.769
But the good news is that
the vitals have stabilized.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.650
Shouldn't be a big problem.

00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:36.673
Where's Sheng Shaoyou?

00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:42.746
He's at the boss's bedside.

00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:44.448
I told you.

00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:46.550
This little lunatic thinks he's so powerful

00:15:46.784 --> 00:15:48.118
he has no sense of restraint

00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.120
he never stops stirring up trouble

00:15:50.654 --> 00:15:52.022
one day it'll backfire on him.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.390
Wenlang.

00:15:54.491 --> 00:15:55.593
The boss isn't awake yet.

00:15:55.893 --> 00:15:56.894
Cut the crap.

00:15:57.428 --> 00:15:58.596
Am I wrong?

00:15:59.263 --> 00:16:01.532
Having an unnatural constitution

00:16:01.732 --> 00:16:03.932
doesn't give you license
to be reckless with your life.

00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:05.328
Think about all these years.

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:06.803
Hasn't he done enough things

00:16:06.804 --> 00:16:07.844
that gamble with his life?

00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:10.507
Everything he does has everyone on pins and needles.

00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:13.811
With such an adorable face

00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:15.446
but a cold, harsh personality.

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:19.074
He doesn't give a damn about anything else to get what he wants.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.052
Is this something a normal person would do?

00:16:22.966 --> 00:16:23.966
Wenlang.

00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:27.124
You can't expect people who live
in that environment to be normal.

00:16:27.637 --> 00:16:28.826
It's not fair to him.

00:16:58.355 --> 00:17:00.291
Boqiao, have you noticed?

00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:02.725
Shaoyou seems to be
interested in those good-looking.

00:17:02.726 --> 00:17:05.029
Omegas, ones who love to cry.

00:17:05.763 --> 00:17:07.031
Look at his exes.

00:17:07.331 --> 00:17:08.799
It's basically the same.

00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:11.769
It seems to be true.

00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:14.705
He does seem to enjoy watching Omegas cry.

00:17:15.973 --> 00:17:16.973
Yes.

00:17:17.274 --> 00:17:20.811
I think the root cause is
Shaoyou's excessive self-demand.

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:22.645
Otherwise, why would he envy those

00:17:22.646 --> 00:17:24.415
who can cry when they face grievances?

00:17:51.575 --> 00:17:52.710
What are you doing here?

00:17:53.811 --> 00:17:54.878
I'm looking for you.

00:17:58.482 --> 00:17:59.482
What's wrong?

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:00.950
Is there a law that says

00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:03.120
a cousin can't visit his
cousin for no reason?

00:18:04.588 --> 00:18:05.588
Yong.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.325
Why are you suddenly looking in the mirror?

00:18:09.293 --> 00:18:11.095
Why are you suddenly looking in the mirror?

00:18:12.463 --> 00:18:13.463
Could it be.

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:16.366
you're in love?

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:20.870
Yeah.

00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:23.873
Really?

00:18:27.911 --> 00:18:28.912
Zuo.

00:18:29.446 --> 00:18:30.446
Let me ask you

00:18:31.215 --> 00:18:33.584
when you were with
Bea, you cried every day.

00:18:33.917 --> 00:18:35.419
How the hell did you pull that off?

00:18:36.487 --> 00:18:38.389
What do you mean, "how"?

00:18:42.726 --> 00:18:43.961
How is someone

00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:45.829
supposed to cry?

00:18:46.263 --> 00:18:47.264
You feel sad,

00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:49.299
and then tears come.

00:18:50.434 --> 00:18:52.903
But I'd bet money you'll
never cry in your life

00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:56.173
I've never seen you shed a tear.

00:18:56.707 --> 00:18:59.142
Bea and I were talking about this recently

00:18:59.143 --> 00:19:01.845
how on earth does he hold back tears?

00:19:03.947 --> 00:19:06.150
Are your tear ducts broken or something?

00:19:35.312 --> 00:19:37.448
[in Cantonese]
Where did this come from?

00:19:38.415 --> 00:19:39.950
It's awful.

00:19:41.452 --> 00:19:42.452
I made it.

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:43.586
You did it?

00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:45.989
Did you take the wrong pills?

00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:48.759
You're so annoying.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.795
Nobody asked.

00:20:04.408 --> 00:20:05.408
Boss.

00:20:05.442 --> 00:20:07.478
The results are in.

00:20:07.811 --> 00:20:09.513
Your eyes are very healthy.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.225
Then why can't I cry?

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:23.393
You're strong, bold.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.996
Aggressive, enterprising,
and very admirable.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.934
I don't want admiration.

00:20:31.535 --> 00:20:32.970
I want to be able to cry.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.972
Do you have any good suggestions?

00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:36.973
Maybe.

00:20:37.868 --> 00:20:39.343
You could find a therapist.

00:20:43.146 --> 00:20:44.381
What do you mean?

00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:46.383
I'm not mentally healthy?

00:20:47.918 --> 00:20:48.986
I didn't mean that.

00:20:50.754 --> 00:20:53.290
Toughness is a rare trait.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.426
But vulnerability is also human nature.

00:20:58.028 --> 00:21:00.230
Haven't you ever felt sorrow

00:21:00.631 --> 00:21:01.632
helplessness

00:21:01.965 --> 00:21:02.966
loss

00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:04.935
or in pain?

00:21:07.638 --> 00:21:08.972
In those moments

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.440
when overwhelmed by emotion

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:13.477
the lacrimal glands
reflexively produce tears

00:21:14.044 --> 00:21:15.546
that's how crying begins.

00:21:17.948 --> 00:21:19.383
When pain feels unbearable

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.486
humans turn to tears as a way to soothe it.

00:21:25.489 --> 00:21:27.424
Unbearable pain?

00:21:29.393 --> 00:21:30.393
I do

00:21:33.864 --> 00:21:35.365
when I long for him

00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:37.734
but can't get close

00:21:39.303 --> 00:21:40.871
it's almost unbearable.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.185
If I can't learn to shed tears.

00:21:59.323 --> 00:22:01.892
I might never bridge the gap between us.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:07.830
Are you awake?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.300
How's it feel?

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.270
Don't move.

00:22:19.343 --> 00:22:20.711
With such a serious injury.

00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:22.004
And having lost so much blood

00:22:22.045 --> 00:22:23.525
but not properly receiving treatment.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.580
Hua Yong.

00:22:24.715 --> 00:22:26.275
What the hell is going on in your head?

00:22:27.784 --> 00:22:29.086
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:30.954
Don't be angry.

00:22:31.088 --> 00:22:32.389
Why should I be angry?

00:22:32.756 --> 00:22:35.125
A lying cheat like you is better off dead.

00:22:35.192 --> 00:22:36.760
Dead things don't cling.

00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:39.095
Lie still

00:22:39.963 --> 00:22:40.963
I'll get the doctor.

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:45.969
Mr. Sheng, please don't go.

00:22:46.603 --> 00:22:47.404
I'm fine.

00:22:47.437 --> 00:22:48.804
Look at your face.

00:22:48.805 --> 00:22:50.307
This is clearly not 'fine'

00:22:52.342 --> 00:22:53.342
Well.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.144
The doctor said you're
an ultra-niche blood type.

00:22:55.145 --> 00:22:57.213
There's no match in any
blood bank in the world.

00:22:57.214 --> 00:22:58.615
You can't lose any more blood.

00:23:01.251 --> 00:23:02.251
Mr. Sheng.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.755
Are you angry?

00:23:04.955 --> 00:23:06.323
But I didn't lie to you

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.758
I told you

00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:08.791
I'm not an Alpha.

00:23:09.626 --> 00:23:11.227
It's Mr. Sheng who doesn't believe in it.

00:23:11.228 --> 00:23:12.461
Who could possibly believe

00:23:12.462 --> 00:23:14.164
something like “Enigma” actually exists?

00:23:24.174 --> 00:23:24.941
Hua Yong.

00:23:25.008 --> 00:23:26.008
Mm.

00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:27.811
Say you love me.

00:23:28.745 --> 00:23:29.813
Is it real?

00:23:31.915 --> 00:23:32.915
Don't move, stay still.

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:37.921
It's true, Mr. Sheng.

00:23:38.689 --> 00:23:39.923
I love you.

00:23:40.624 --> 00:23:41.792
I hope you're happy

00:23:42.426 --> 00:23:43.927
and you like me too.

00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:45.595
Then don't mess around anymore.

00:23:46.163 --> 00:23:48.632
I can't be happy seeing you hurt.

00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:49.933
I'm sad.

00:23:50.767 --> 00:23:51.767
Hua Yong.

00:23:52.235 --> 00:23:53.870
Do you want to see me in pain?

00:23:56.606 --> 00:23:57.341
Well.

00:23:57.574 --> 00:23:58.809
Then lie down

00:23:59.443 --> 00:24:00.443
I'll get the doctor.

00:24:04.715 --> 00:24:06.783
Didn't I tell you to lie still?

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.519
The wound has split again.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.188
That's significant blood loss.

00:24:11.189 --> 00:24:12.289
Doesn't it hurt?

00:24:12.989 --> 00:24:15.192
Mr. Sheng, I'm not in pain.

00:24:17.828 --> 00:24:19.763
It's fine, right?

00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:32.809
Does it hurt you to see me wounded?

00:24:36.446 --> 00:24:37.581
Hua Yong.

00:24:38.248 --> 00:24:39.449
It hurts me, too.

00:24:56.333 --> 00:24:57.666
Don't worry, Mr. Sheng

00:24:57.667 --> 00:24:58.667
I'll be fine

00:25:00.403 --> 00:25:02.404
I've rebandaged Mr. Hua properly this time.

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:03.373
The wound is deep

00:25:03.374 --> 00:25:04.441
and it hurts the glands.

00:25:04.608 --> 00:25:06.543
An ordinary person
wouldn't have survived this.

00:25:07.144 --> 00:25:08.878
You must follow
postoperative care strictly.

00:25:08.879 --> 00:25:11.147
Try to avoid to excessive movement.

00:25:11.148 --> 00:25:12.149
And no water contact.

00:25:12.749 --> 00:25:14.284
Okay, thank you.

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:17.154
Oh, Mr. Sheng.

00:25:17.287 --> 00:25:20.222
Doctor Wang said your blood
report has several abnormalities.

00:25:20.223 --> 00:25:22.425
You'll need to have tested again.

00:25:22.692 --> 00:25:24.003
Would now be a convenient time for you?

00:25:24.027 --> 00:25:25.929
I'll have a colleague take you to the lab

00:25:26.163 --> 00:25:27.163
Abnormalities?

00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:28.565
What's abnormal?

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:30.833
For safety's sake

00:25:30.834 --> 00:25:32.903
we drew a full blood sample from Mr. Sheng

00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:34.704
and conducted every possible test.

00:25:34.805 --> 00:25:38.175
The result shows that Sheng's
total progesterone is 12.6.

00:25:38.475 --> 00:25:40.744
It's a value only found during pregnancy.

00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:43.646
Pregnancy?

00:25:43.847 --> 00:25:45.916
The standard of your
hospital is a real concern

00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:47.384
I'm an S-Class Alpha.

00:25:47.717 --> 00:25:48.952
How can I get pregnant?

00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:02.866
He's not replying to WeChat

00:26:02.933 --> 00:26:04.167
and his phone is off.

00:26:04.868 --> 00:26:06.336
What the hell is Gao Tu doing?

00:26:07.637 --> 00:26:09.372
Is he at the hospital with Gao Qing?

00:26:14.444 --> 00:26:16.413
Since I'm already here

00:26:16.913 --> 00:26:20.984
dropping by to visit my old
classmate's sister seems reasonable.

00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:46.642
Gao Tu.

00:26:47.244 --> 00:26:48.245
Are you inside?

00:26:52.849 --> 00:26:53.850
Are you okay?

00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:55.485
Open the door.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:00.924
I'm fine.

00:27:02.826 --> 00:27:03.826
Are you okay?

00:27:42.532 --> 00:27:43.532
Are you okay?

00:27:44.634 --> 00:27:45.634
Mr. Shen.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.071
What are you doing here?

00:27:48.371 --> 00:27:49.406
Hua Yong is hospitalized.

00:27:50.273 --> 00:27:51.273
I went to visit him.

00:27:59.749 --> 00:28:00.984
Are you sure you're okay?

00:28:04.654 --> 00:28:05.488
I'm fine.

00:28:05.522 --> 00:28:07.042
Then why don't you answer my messages?

00:28:09.726 --> 00:28:10.760
Texts...

00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:14.098
Maybe I didn't notice...

00:28:14.123 --> 00:28:15.124
Didn't notice?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.435
Then why did you pay me back?

00:28:18.969 --> 00:28:20.770
The deadline was coming up.

00:28:28.945 --> 00:28:29.945
Mr. Shen.

00:28:30.013 --> 00:28:31.615
What do you want from me?

00:28:31.915 --> 00:28:33.049
What's wrong with you?

00:28:34.584 --> 00:28:35.584
Why did you throw up?

00:28:38.488 --> 00:28:39.488
Gastroenteritis.

00:28:41.358 --> 00:28:42.358
Gao Tu

00:28:43.126 --> 00:28:44.126
tell the truth.

00:28:44.561 --> 00:28:45.561
Mr. Shen.

00:28:48.398 --> 00:28:51.433
I have to take care of my family these days, I'm
very busy.

00:28:52.235 --> 00:28:53.646
I don't look at my cell phone as much

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:54.670
Family?

00:28:56.673 --> 00:28:58.353
The Omega who got pregnant out of wedlock.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.277
You threw up like that.

00:29:01.945 --> 00:29:03.945
If you didn't know, you'd
think you were pregnant.

00:29:04.214 --> 00:29:05.214
I didn't.

00:29:08.284 --> 00:29:10.520
Mr. Shen, please don't joke about this.

00:29:14.391 --> 00:29:15.759
Please pass it on for me.

00:29:17.027 --> 00:29:18.762
I wish Secretary Hua a speedy recovery.

00:29:19.329 --> 00:29:20.863
I have to go.

00:29:20.864 --> 00:29:21.864
Don't go yet.

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:24.947
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:29:25.135 --> 00:29:26.135
You don't respond on WeChat.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:27.971
Your phone is off.

00:29:28.972 --> 00:29:30.692
And you're making yourself look so haggard.

00:29:31.563 --> 00:29:31.930
Gao Tu

00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:33.149
What?

00:29:35.845 --> 00:29:37.013
Do you need money?

00:29:38.214 --> 00:29:39.015
No.

00:29:39.115 --> 00:29:40.115
What do you mean by “no”?

00:29:43.053 --> 00:29:44.120
You look pale.

00:29:45.288 --> 00:29:46.848
Haven't you been eating properly again?

00:29:48.825 --> 00:29:49.825
Gao Tu.

00:29:50.026 --> 00:29:51.694
Tell me if you have any problems.

00:29:52.495 --> 00:29:53.863
We were in the same class.

00:29:54.864 --> 00:29:56.266
I will definitely help you.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:01.870
No need.

00:30:04.674 --> 00:30:06.009
I don't need any help.

00:30:07.711 --> 00:30:09.012
I eat a lot every day.

00:30:11.915 --> 00:30:13.483
Thank you, Mr. Shen, for your concern

00:30:14.384 --> 00:30:15.585
I've got things to do

00:30:15.885 --> 00:30:16.953
I'll leave.

00:30:26.629 --> 00:30:28.998
This is the third test already.

00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:30.365
The Progesterone levels

00:30:30.366 --> 00:30:31.634
are still the same as before.

00:30:32.802 --> 00:30:34.069
So it's confirmed

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.371
Mr. Sheng is pregnant.

00:30:36.206 --> 00:30:37.206
Yes.

00:30:38.608 --> 00:30:40.410
We organized a
multidisciplinary consultation

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.610
and now we can basically
confirm it's a pregnancy.

00:30:43.246 --> 00:30:45.715
But based on the available data so far

00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:47.416
there's no documented case of

00:30:47.417 --> 00:30:50.086
pregnancy from an Enigma-Alpha bond.

00:30:50.754 --> 00:30:51.721
So?

00:30:51.722 --> 00:30:54.557
Most of our experts
still have reservations.

00:30:54.891 --> 00:30:55.891
What do you mean?

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.060
Here's the thing.

00:30:58.428 --> 00:31:00.539
Although the drug residue
indicators in Mr. Sheng's blood

00:31:00.563 --> 00:31:02.465
are far below the teratogenic level.

00:31:02.732 --> 00:31:05.135
But we still need consider the history
of unknown drug ingestion.

00:31:05.435 --> 00:31:06.970
So my personal advice is that

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.572
you'd better decide carefully.

00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:10.973
Decide what?

00:31:11.074 --> 00:31:12.175
The child's name?

00:31:12.709 --> 00:31:14.010
We'll make a good decision.

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:17.647
As a doctor

00:31:17.914 --> 00:31:19.382
I don't recommend keeping the baby.

00:31:26.055 --> 00:31:28.191
You're making my Alpha abort our baby?

00:31:31.561 --> 00:31:33.963
I know it's hard to accept.

00:31:34.597 --> 00:31:35.864
But we have to consider

00:31:35.865 --> 00:31:37.266
the unknown history of drug intake, right?

00:31:37.267 --> 00:31:39.001
Can you please stop giving
me unnecessary advice?

00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:40.403
Don't make things difficult for me.

00:31:40.737 --> 00:31:42.639
Enigma's kids aren't that fragile.

00:31:43.006 --> 00:31:44.106
Keep your mouth shut

00:31:44.107 --> 00:31:45.241
I'd appreciate it.

00:31:45.708 --> 00:31:47.010
Alright, stop it.

00:31:48.645 --> 00:31:49.846
Mr. Sheng.

00:31:50.713 --> 00:31:52.147
Threatening a doctor at
a doctor's appointment.

00:31:52.148 --> 00:31:53.349
You think you're in Country P?

00:31:54.784 --> 00:31:55.784
Mr. Sheng.

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:57.353
I wasn't threatening him.

00:31:58.288 --> 00:32:00.328
Don't worry about that
medication affecting Peanut.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.925
Peanut has my genes

00:32:02.225 --> 00:32:03.992
and they won't be affected
by that small amount of drug exposure.

00:32:03.993 --> 00:32:04.993
Shut up!

00:32:05.728 --> 00:32:07.197
I'll deal with you later.

00:32:12.001 --> 00:32:13.001
Explain.

00:32:14.704 --> 00:32:15.705
Explain what?

00:32:17.207 --> 00:32:19.742
What's the deal with pregnancy
and permanent marking?

00:32:21.044 --> 00:32:22.412
I told you.

00:32:23.112 --> 00:32:24.947
The kidnappers injected you with cyanide.

00:32:24.948 --> 00:32:26.281
If I hadn't permanently marked you.

00:32:26.282 --> 00:32:27.150
you would've died.

00:32:27.151 --> 00:32:29.117
Mr. Sheng, if you die

00:32:29.118 --> 00:32:30.118
I'm gonna die, too.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.921
A freak who can't even
be killed by cyanide.

00:32:32.922 --> 00:32:34.389
Stop acting like it's
life or death all the time.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:36.310
Just because you're
Enigma and smarter than most

00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:37.937
doesn't mean the rest
of us Alphas are idiots

00:32:37.961 --> 00:32:38.962
I wouldn't dare.

00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:42.584
So what's the deal with the pregnancy?

00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:45.134
I said we should take precautions.

00:32:45.535 --> 00:32:46.769
Mr. Sheng refused.

00:32:49.339 --> 00:32:50.339
But still.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.674
It's mostly my fault

00:32:51.975 --> 00:32:53.343
I couldn't resist the temptation.

00:32:54.444 --> 00:32:56.446
But when it comes to Mr. Sheng

00:32:56.746 --> 00:32:58.414
I'm just weak-willed.

00:32:59.048 --> 00:33:00.450
I can resist anything...

00:33:04.754 --> 00:33:06.222
except your temptation.

00:33:07.156 --> 00:33:08.156
Besides.

00:33:08.958 --> 00:33:10.158
I really want us

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:11.728
to have a baby together soon.

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:19.669
You should be sold to
the zoo as an exhibit.

00:33:21.804 --> 00:33:23.573
Will Mr. Sheng come to
watch my performance?

00:33:23.748 --> 00:33:24.582
Playing what?

00:33:24.607 --> 00:33:25.607
The role of a pervert?

00:33:29.245 --> 00:33:30.245
A mermaid.

00:33:30.913 --> 00:33:32.215
I'm good at swimming.

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:35.084
I once read a fairytale

00:33:35.385 --> 00:33:36.419
and it said,

00:33:37.387 --> 00:33:39.087
Mermaids need the bodily
fluids of their beloved humans

00:33:39.088 --> 00:33:40.590
to transform into having legs.

00:33:42.358 --> 00:33:43.626
How did that book you read

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.627
ever get published?

00:33:45.628 --> 00:33:46.628
Unpublished.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.331
I wrote that myself.

00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:50.133
Ten short stories in all.

00:33:50.466 --> 00:33:52.402
The main characters are Mr. Sheng and me.

00:33:53.703 --> 00:33:55.672
Seriously, what breed of pervert are you?

00:34:01.344 --> 00:34:03.346
The kind that can make Mr. Sheng pregnant.

00:34:04.714 --> 00:34:06.754
How could I really believe
that you could make me…?

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.085
Mr. Sheng, I've told you before.

00:34:10.086 --> 00:34:11.086
Do you remember?

00:34:11.154 --> 00:34:12.388
And I said.

00:34:12.522 --> 00:34:14.924
Our first child will be called Peanut.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160
Mr. Sheng.

00:34:18.394 --> 00:34:19.929
Just have a baby for me

00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:22.264
I really, really want a kid from you

00:34:22.265 --> 00:34:23.265
I'm begging you.

00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:27.948
I'm an Alpha, how the hell
am I supposed to get pregnant?

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:35.144
A few years ago

00:34:35.311 --> 00:34:36.411
I built a specialized medical team

00:34:36.412 --> 00:34:39.015
for Mr. Sheng in Country P.

00:34:39.515 --> 00:34:40.917
As long as Mr. Sheng is willing.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.430
They'll come to JIANGHU anytime.

00:34:44.387 --> 00:34:46.055
Don't you want to have a child with me?

00:34:47.023 --> 00:34:49.503
Are you really in such a hurry
to have a child out of wedlock?

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.794
But I don't.

00:34:52.562 --> 00:34:54.030
I plan every day

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:55.999
how to propose to Mr. Sheng.

00:34:59.602 --> 00:35:00.903
Stop saying ridiculous things.

00:35:02.305 --> 00:35:03.305
To be frank

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.049
besides enhanced
purification and healing abilities

00:35:06.442 --> 00:35:09.078
what other effects will
permanent marking have on me?

00:35:11.114 --> 00:35:12.515
Almost all good effects.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:14.884
Almost all?

00:35:14.884 --> 00:35:15.884
Yes.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.489
The only downside is that.

00:35:20.289 --> 00:35:21.890
Mr. Sheng's rut period

00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:23.092
will become a heat period

00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:24.360
and synchronize with me.

00:35:24.727 --> 00:35:25.894
Beside these.

00:35:25.895 --> 00:35:26.963
All good effects.

00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:29.731
My physical strength,
intelligence, and healing ability

00:35:29.732 --> 00:35:31.210
all far exceed those of ordinary humans.

00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:34.114
These will all be passed on to the
other half through permanent marking.

00:35:36.038 --> 00:35:37.038
Mr. Sheng.

00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:40.843
You'll have 30% of my abilities.

00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:44.559
And one hundred percent of my love.

00:35:45.014 --> 00:35:46.014
What about the price?

00:35:46.492 --> 00:35:48.203
Talking about rights
without responsibilities

00:35:48.251 --> 00:35:49.786
Mr. Hua, are you coaxing a child?

00:35:50.586 --> 00:35:51.686
Your only obligation

00:35:51.687 --> 00:35:52.789
is to love me.

00:35:53.723 --> 00:35:55.291
Can you do that, Mr. Sheng?

00:35:55.391 --> 00:35:57.711
Mr. Hua's habit of acting
first and asking questions later

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.195
doesn't make him easy to love.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.099
So, Mr. Sheng, what kind do you like?

00:36:03.199 --> 00:36:04.199
The obedient kind.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.170
Lie to me again

00:36:08.404 --> 00:36:09.404
and I'll kill you.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.784
I would never lie to you.

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:37.920
[A close up of a lemon soda bottle for some reason?]

00:36:42.205 --> 00:36:43.072
Brother, get some rest

00:36:43.073 --> 00:36:44.240
I'll do it myself.

00:36:44.307 --> 00:36:45.307
That won't do.

00:36:45.408 --> 00:36:46.441
Although you got discharged from the hospital.

00:36:46.442 --> 00:36:48.143
you still just had major surgery.

00:36:48.144 --> 00:36:49.545
You still need to get some rest.

00:36:50.646 --> 00:36:52.682
Don't you need to rest more than I do?

00:36:53.049 --> 00:36:53.783
Sit down

00:36:53.783 --> 00:36:54.783
I'll be fine.

00:36:57.086 --> 00:36:58.086
And brother.

00:36:58.654 --> 00:37:00.323
Are we really moving back to YISHI?

00:37:00.423 --> 00:37:02.724
The medical facilities
there are much worse, right?

00:37:02.725 --> 00:37:04.327
Will it affect the baby?

00:37:04.527 --> 00:37:07.363
We have no choice, the rent
in JIANGHU is too expensive.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.533
Besides, the medical
care in YISHI isn't that bad.

00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:12.801
But brother, if we stay in JIANGHU.

00:37:12.802 --> 00:37:14.437
Dad contacted me the other day.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.172
You can't give him money anymore.

00:37:16.873 --> 00:37:17.873
I know I know.

00:37:18.474 --> 00:37:20.209
I changed my phone number.

00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:23.079
But if we don't move

00:37:23.312 --> 00:37:24.847
I'm still worried about trouble.

00:37:26.315 --> 00:37:27.315
You're right

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.785
I told you can't contact him anymore.

00:37:29.986 --> 00:37:31.320
Gao Ming is a bottomless pit.

00:37:31.354 --> 00:37:32.088
The more you give

00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:33.089
the more he gambles

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.157
and the more he owes.

00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:35.825
But

00:37:35.992 --> 00:37:37.292
given your current condition

00:37:37.293 --> 00:37:38.560
wouldn't it be better to stay in a big city

00:37:38.561 --> 00:37:40.563
with easy access to major hospitals?

00:37:45.268 --> 00:37:47.036
If you're worried about the rent

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.105
we can get a smaller place

00:37:49.305 --> 00:37:51.573
even in the suburbs.

00:37:51.574 --> 00:37:53.819
But that would make it
inconvenient for you to attend classes.

00:37:53.843 --> 00:37:55.111
YISHI is a bit small.

00:37:55.444 --> 00:37:57.412
But the educational
resources are pretty good, so...

00:37:57.413 --> 00:37:58.281
Brother.

00:37:58.282 --> 00:37:59.916
You're not alone now.

00:38:00.116 --> 00:38:01.349
You can't just think of me.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.085
You have to think about the baby.

00:38:03.753 --> 00:38:04.587
Oh.

00:38:04.654 --> 00:38:06.187
Doctor Wang of the
Pheromone department of HECI

00:38:06.188 --> 00:38:07.890
holds free clinics every Sunday

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.157
I asked the nurse for help

00:38:09.158 --> 00:38:10.638
and got his assistant's phone number.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.228
You can find him in the future.

00:38:13.863 --> 00:38:14.863
Brother.

00:38:14.997 --> 00:38:16.399
Let's stay in JIANGHU.

00:38:16.766 --> 00:38:18.467
Big cities have better medical resources

00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:19.601
and more opportunities.

00:38:19.635 --> 00:38:20.969
When I graduate and start earning money

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.039
I can support the family with you, okay?

00:38:24.807 --> 00:38:25.807
Good.

00:38:26.642 --> 00:38:27.642
Mm.

00:38:46.228 --> 00:38:47.228
Tea's ready.

00:38:47.597 --> 00:38:49.632
Shall I bring it over to you?

00:39:17.426 --> 00:39:20.630
Hello, the number you
dialed does not exist.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.365
Please check it and dial later.

00:39:27.303 --> 00:39:30.506
Hello, the number you
dialed does not exist.

00:39:30.606 --> 00:39:32.241
Please check it and dial later.

00:39:36.312 --> 00:39:39.315
Hello, the number you
dialed does not exist.

00:39:42.451 --> 00:39:45.687
Hello, The number you
dialed does not exist.

00:39:45.688 --> 00:39:47.323
Please check it and dial later.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320
Hey.

00:40:19.455 --> 00:40:20.455
What's up.

00:40:20.489 --> 00:40:22.358
Gao Tu's phone number got disconnected.

00:40:22.692 --> 00:40:23.692
So?

00:40:23.793 --> 00:40:25.728
How did his number become disconnected?

00:40:26.128 --> 00:40:28.140
When a number's no longer
in use, it becomes invalid.

00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:29.165
It's just common sense.

00:40:29.598 --> 00:40:31.000
How am I supposed to contact him?

00:40:31.867 --> 00:40:33.268
You already agreed to let him resign.

00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:34.436
Why are you still contacting him?

00:40:34.437 --> 00:40:36.204
Is there some law that says once he quits

00:40:36.205 --> 00:40:37.965
I'm not allowed to reach
out to him anymore?

00:40:39.241 --> 00:40:40.241
Hua Yong.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.011
Gao Tu moved.

00:40:42.244 --> 00:40:43.446
But he didn't go back home

00:40:44.246 --> 00:40:45.815
and he hasn't joined another company.

00:40:46.391 --> 00:40:47.725
And he also deleted his number.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:48.750
Do you think...

00:40:49.485 --> 00:40:50.965
something might have happened to him?

00:40:52.188 --> 00:40:53.988
And you went to his
hometown to look for him?

00:40:54.123 --> 00:40:55.123
Yeah.

00:40:55.358 --> 00:40:56.358
What's the problem?

00:40:59.595 --> 00:41:00.595
Wenlang.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.250
Secretary Gao's probably the
kind of person who has a plan.

00:41:03.733 --> 00:41:06.801
I think he just doesn't want to
be around people and things from the past.

00:41:06.802 --> 00:41:07.803
How can that be?

00:41:08.504 --> 00:41:09.504
Why not?

00:41:13.776 --> 00:41:14.776
Wenlang.

00:41:15.371 --> 00:41:16.945
Do you like Secretary Gao too?

00:41:16.946 --> 00:41:17.946
How can that be?

00:41:18.948 --> 00:41:19.948
Wait.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.385
What do you mean by “too”?

00:41:23.953 --> 00:41:25.087
Who else likes him?

00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:27.989
Nobody.

00:41:28.357 --> 00:41:30.091
I hate talking to idiots.

00:41:30.092 --> 00:41:30.726
That's all.

00:41:31.093 --> 00:41:31.627
Wait a second.

00:41:31.927 --> 00:41:32.927
Hua Yong.

00:41:33.095 --> 00:41:35.407
Don't forget who helped you put on
that act to win over Sheng Shaoyou

00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:37.008
Are you planning to burn
the bridge after crossing it?

00:41:37.032 --> 00:41:38.032
Hmm?

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.367
Burning the bridge after crossing it

00:41:39.368 --> 00:41:40.636
is not against the law.

00:41:41.237 --> 00:41:42.237
You.

00:41:44.907 --> 00:41:45.907
What's wrong?

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:48.810
If you can't look yourself in the eye.

00:41:48.811 --> 00:41:50.731
No matter how many
times you call, it's useless.

00:41:51.013 --> 00:41:53.248
Wenlang, wait until you figure it out

00:41:53.249 --> 00:41:55.250
whether you like Secretary Gao or not.

00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:56.051
Wait, wait.

00:41:56.118 --> 00:41:57.118
What?

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720
I've thought it through.

00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:01.123
What do you think we should do?

00:42:03.626 --> 00:42:04.693
Do what?

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.328
How can I find Gao Tu?

00:42:08.831 --> 00:42:11.634
So you're admitting that
you like Secretary Gao.

00:42:11.967 --> 00:42:13.802
Can you stop talking that much?

00:42:13.803 --> 00:42:16.071
Tell me, how do I find Gao Tu?

00:42:18.007 --> 00:42:20.108
Wenlang, at this point

00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:22.011
it's probably too late to fix things.

00:42:22.111 --> 00:42:23.111
What do you mean?

00:42:24.013 --> 00:42:25.881
Do you know who Omega was that night?

00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:28.083
Gao Tu said the hotel's CCTV was down

00:42:28.211 --> 00:42:29.851
and he didn't get a picture of that face.

00:42:30.352 --> 00:42:32.488
What's this got to do
with me finding Gao Tu?

00:42:35.191 --> 00:42:36.692
Do you mean that.

00:42:37.393 --> 00:42:39.495
Gao Tu was in league with that Omega?

00:42:39.528 --> 00:42:40.848
They plotted against me together.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:42.531
Gao Tu was Omega that night.

00:42:43.432 --> 00:42:44.432
What did you say?

00:42:44.733 --> 00:42:46.936
I've sent the photo to Secretary Gao.

00:42:47.269 --> 00:42:49.438
Let him decide if he
wants to tell you the truth.

00:42:49.872 --> 00:42:50.973
The result is

00:42:52.875 --> 00:42:55.511
seems like he's made up his
mind not to continue with you.

00:42:55.678 --> 00:42:57.313
That's why he chose to quit.

00:42:58.013 --> 00:42:59.048
How can that be?

00:43:00.115 --> 00:43:01.317
Gao Tu is a Beta.

00:43:02.184 --> 00:43:03.184
Wenlang.

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:04.586
Secretary Gao should be your

00:43:04.587 --> 00:43:06.555
only acceptable Omega left.

00:43:06.989 --> 00:43:08.224
You'd better hold on tight

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.426
or you might end up growing old alone.

00:43:13.028 --> 00:43:14.028
I'll leave you to it

00:43:14.129 --> 00:43:16.097
I have to keep making soup for Mr. Sheng.

00:43:16.098 --> 00:43:17.098
Good Luck.

00:43:31.714 --> 00:43:33.749
Lao Gao, you gambled
all night again yesterday.

00:43:35.117 --> 00:43:36.251
Fucking hell, what a bummer

00:43:36.252 --> 00:43:38.012
I've been losing for a
whole month straight.

00:43:38.187 --> 00:43:39.187
That's not work.

00:43:46.195 --> 00:43:47.328
Hello? Who's there?

00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:48.230
Oh, Hi

00:43:48.306 --> 00:43:50.374
I work for Omega Protection Agency.

00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:52.635
Are you Mr. Gao Ming,
family member of Gao Tu?

00:43:53.269 --> 00:43:55.538
Omega Protection Agency.

00:43:55.871 --> 00:43:56.405
No,

00:43:56.406 --> 00:43:58.474
What does this have to
do with my son, Gao Tu?

00:43:58.974 --> 00:43:59.974
It's because

00:44:00.009 --> 00:44:02.545
Mr. Gao Tu suffers from a
severe pheromone disorder.

00:44:02.645 --> 00:44:04.013
And he've been seeing a doctor.

00:44:04.513 --> 00:44:06.749
But he hasn't been to
the hospital for two weeks.

00:44:07.249 --> 00:44:08.183
Considering his safety.

00:44:08.184 --> 00:44:09.344
The doctor called the police.

00:44:10.386 --> 00:44:12.554
No, what the hell are you talking about?

00:44:12.888 --> 00:44:14.957
Mr. Gao is in critical condition.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.691
Omega with a pheromone disorder

00:44:16.692 --> 00:44:18.336
shouldn't have gotten
pregnant without authorization.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.929
We can't reach him now.

00:44:19.995 --> 00:44:21.897
If you, as a family
member, can contact him.

00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:23.851
Please make sure he gets medical attention.

00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:46.288
Boss.

00:44:46.722 --> 00:44:49.358
The ads you ordered
are all set.

00:44:51.278 --> 00:44:52.260
Hmm.

00:45:39.842 --> 00:45:41.210
Have you seen the news yet?

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:44.145
X Hotel, which never accepts ad placements.

00:45:44.146 --> 00:45:47.182
The billboard is actually looping
a marriage proposal today.

00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:49.017
The one being proposed to

00:45:49.018 --> 00:45:51.153
is Mr. Sheng from SHENGFANG Biotech.

00:45:51.253 --> 00:45:52.553
Of course.

00:45:52.554 --> 00:45:54.756
It's been trending all morning.

00:45:54.757 --> 00:45:56.091
That's so romantic.

00:45:56.525 --> 00:45:58.259
You know who?

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.094
Who the hell is it?

00:45:59.095 --> 00:46:00.328
That's very thoughtful.

00:46:00.329 --> 00:46:01.896
It's not just about thoughtfulness

00:46:01.897 --> 00:46:03.699
it's about money and love.

00:46:03.866 --> 00:46:05.633
Do you even know what
kind of place X Hotel is?

00:46:05.634 --> 00:46:07.835
Even a standard room costs
tens of thousands a night.

00:46:07.836 --> 00:46:10.072
Let alone a high-profile ad like this.

00:46:10.906 --> 00:46:11.906
Look at this.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.242
It's all over the Internet.

00:46:13.409 --> 00:46:14.709
They say the one who proposed in public

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.979
is the mysterious head of X Holdings.

00:46:17.713 --> 00:46:19.782
Mr. Sheng is an S-class Alpha, right?

00:46:19.915 --> 00:46:22.817
Who would've thought the
all-powerful head of X Holdings

00:46:22.818 --> 00:46:24.852
.turns out to be an Omega chasing love?

00:46:24.853 --> 00:46:26.555
That's wild.

00:46:27.189 --> 00:46:28.489
So jealous.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.991
Who could say no to that?

00:46:29.992 --> 00:46:31.426
A public confession like that.

00:46:31.427 --> 00:46:34.128
Yeah, back when I had a
fight with my Alpha in school.

00:46:34.129 --> 00:46:36.297
He posted a public
apology on the bulletin board.

00:46:36.298 --> 00:46:38.434
I was so touched, I nearly
married him on the spot.

00:46:39.468 --> 00:46:41.003
A public apology?

00:46:42.171 --> 00:46:43.172
Mr. Shen.

00:46:47.009 --> 00:46:48.009
Nosy.

00:46:49.178 --> 00:46:50.978
Why did my father call
me here in such a hurry?

00:46:50.979 --> 00:46:52.213
Is it a recurring condition?

00:46:52.214 --> 00:46:53.649
The chairman's condition is stable.

00:46:53.715 --> 00:46:54.216
You're here

00:46:54.217 --> 00:46:56.452
about the X Hotel
billboard proposal, I assume
