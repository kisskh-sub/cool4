(The Death of Chi Yu)

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.160
Since you want the Xuanzhu Jade so bad,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.920
I shall return your favor

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.560
with its flame!

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.480
No! Chi Yu, no!

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
Stop it!

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.800
If I die,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.600
you will perish too!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.560
If I can

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.966
save the world

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.640
by defeating an evil demon like you,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.120
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.880
No! No!

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.960
Chi Yu!

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.720
Chi Yu!

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.320
Chi Yu!

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.600
Chi Yu!

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.560
Chi Yu!

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.400
It's alright.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.880
You're safe now.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.200
Everything's fine now.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.360
It's alright.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.480
Why is the Xuanzhu Jade in you?

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.400
Have you thought it through?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.200
There's a twin-soul contract
between us.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.280
Only by moving the Xuanzhu Jade into me

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.480
can she live.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.040
But you're not the Wangshu Vessel.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.680
According to the secret technique
mentioned in the Scarlet Flame Holy Book,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.320
a divine beast
must destroy its divine bone

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.320
to obtain the mortal Wangshu Vessel.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.040
(The Xuanzhu Jade is way too powerful.)

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.720
(Even though
you have the twin-soul contract,)

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.640
(in the end,)

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.600
(you will still perish.)

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.560
(This is the only way)

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.320
(to disperse the Xuanzhu Jade's energy)

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.760
(and have
the invincible evil spirit of An Sha)

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.680
sealed completely.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.700
That way, the Scarlet Flame Clan
which has been sealed in ice

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.680
will be released too.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.920
That incident
has always been a thorn in my flesh.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.880
(I didn't manage to stop
the Silver Fox Clan's plot.)

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.280
(And I've done everyone wronged.)

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.320
(This thorn has been tormenting me
all these years.)

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.200
(I'm tired.)

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.480
(I want to remove this thorn.)

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440
Please help me.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.480
We're safe now.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.120
Chi Yu, are you alright?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.240
Let's tend to your wound first.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.600
Chi Yu, are you feeling better?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.440
Chi Yu?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.720
Chi Yu?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.800
Chi Yu!

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.800
Chi Yu!

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.080
Chi Yu!

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.520
Chi Yu!

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.400
Chi... Chi Yu.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.080
No...

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.880
Please don't...

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.320
Give... Give me the Xuanzhu Jade now.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.480
Hurry.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.360
I... I will fulfill our promise

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.200
and unseal your clan members.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.240
Quick, give it to me.

There's a price to everything.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.560
It's my mission

to reinstate the Xuanzhu Jade

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.840
and save my clan members.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.680
That way,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.080
you can live.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.840
No... That won't do.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.360
You can't do this.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.160
You can't do this!

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.680
You can't do this!

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.000
If you do this, you will perish!

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.720
