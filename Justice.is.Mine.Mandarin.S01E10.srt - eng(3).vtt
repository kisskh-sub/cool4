00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.560
Violence in the Old City District
is getting worse.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.600
It's not only affecting
public safety,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.119
but also bringing
negative impacts...

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.520
to the gambling industry of Hokong.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.999
I hereby call upon the police...

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.960
to seriously address this issue.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.239
We'll go to commercial first.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.800
Next up is international news.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.800
What is it, Judge Qin?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.719
Hello.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.600
I'd like to ask,
how is Wei doing now?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.439
He's half-dead.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.359
And now you care about him?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.480
Has the bullet been removed?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.560
What else did the doctor say?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.960
We're not in the hospital.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.760
Where did you go?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.199
I won't tell you.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.520
Don't expect Wei to work for you
anymore.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.839
(Justice Is Mine)

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.640
(Episode 10)

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120
Tang Jia.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.279
If you don't accept that watch,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.319
is it your sister's idea...

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.679
or yours?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.799
My sister's idea...

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.840
is my idea.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.439
It's my job to take care
of patients.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.720
You don't need to give me gifts.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.640
This watch isn't for hospital fees.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.120
It's a token of my gratitude.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.240
My sister is a police officer.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.280
What does that have to do
with anything?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.800
We're not the same kind of people.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.280
Hey!

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
Young Master Lie.

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.680
Young Master Gang is responding.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.120
Ms. Lin just showed him
the news of Mr. Long's sentence.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.720
He's responding.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.640
Dad.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.200
Xiao Lie.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.960
Han Gang.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040
Han Gang.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.040
Xiao Lie.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.920
- Han Gang.
- Xiao Lie.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.440
It's good that you're awake.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.920
How's Dad in prison?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200
He's fine.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.080
He's just worried about you.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.960
I'm worried about him too.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.999
I heard from Ms. Lin...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.559
that I was hit by a car.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.440
I've been in the hospital
for over half a month.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.320
That's right.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.480
The person who hit you...

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200
was him.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.320
His name is Ma Shan Bao.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.479
But don't worry.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.880
We've avenged you.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.480
It's not him.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.360
That's not the look in his eyes.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240
It's not him.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.519
- Han Gang.
- It's not him.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.600
You've seen the culprit?

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.800
Do you know who he is?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.400
I don't know him.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.560
But if I see him again,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.280
I'll definitely recognize him.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240
It's not him.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240
Take your time.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.240
Firearms robbery?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.239
I have a weapon
of mass destruction right here.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.280
Do I need to rob?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
Where's the evidence?

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.519
You can't catch the real culprit,
so you frame me,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.760
a law-abiding citizen.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.120
Without evidence,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.880
even the King of Heaven
would have to let someone go.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.000
Boss, we've found it.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.119
Qi Chang Rong has an alibi...

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.560
while the firearms
were being stolen.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.439
Even if he didn't do it,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.759
I'm sure he's the mastermind.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.760
Why else would he be
at the scene of the explosion?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.320
He's preparing to go to war
with Han Lie.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.079
What should we do with him?

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.359
They like fighting so much.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.520
Let them fight all they want.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.600
If there really isn't enough
evidence by then,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.639
let him go when the time comes.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.640
Yes, sir.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.720
We took four kilos of heroin
from him...

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.920
and killed two of his men.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.239
His hideout in the city...

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.440
was also taken by us.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.640
Plus karaoke and massage parlors.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Get out!

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.120
Get out! Get lost!

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160
Get out!

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:42.759
In two weeks,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.039
Qi Chang Rong will no longer...

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.599
have a foothold in Hokong.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.479
He'll have to go back
to the Old City District...

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.799
and wait for relief.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800
That's enough.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680
Dad.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.520
Those guns and explosives...

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.680
were used by Qi Chang Rong
against us.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.879
Even the police...

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.360
don't have evidence to arrest him.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.359
Instead, you left behind your own
incriminating evidence.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.680
I told you,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.279
we should just stand aside...

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.799
and watch the show.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.039
I don't want to be led by the nose.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.280
We should strike first.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.120
How's your brother?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.399
The doctor said...

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.920
he'll let him get out
of bed today...

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.960
and continue with physiotherapy.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680
Good.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.560
Dad,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.040
If all this were done by my brother,

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.440
would you think it's okay?

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.200
When your brother recovers,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.559
you'll see what he'll do.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.760
Then you'll know the answer.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.360
Mr. Qi.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.999
I'm sorry, Mr. Qi.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.399
A whole bunch of them barged in.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.600
We weren't prepared.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.999
Take this for our men's medical.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.159
After they recover,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.119
we'll get everything back from Han,
with interest.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.399
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.400
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.279
Mr. Qi,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.239
they took our hideout
on Heimu Street.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.879
The Gao brothers went
to get the goods,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.399
but they haven't come back yet.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.880
Something might have happened
to them.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.399
Remember this.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.639
Sooner or later,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.080
Han will have to pay for this.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.320
But right now,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.160
I'm settling a score with Cao.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.120
Let's go.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.560
Sha Sha, it's me.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Mr. Peng.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.039
I was afraid I'd be followed,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.120
so I took a few detours.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.919
I'm sorry, Mr. Peng.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.000
I've troubled you, but...

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.080
you really have to help me save Wei.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.559
Your dad asked me to tell you this.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.399
He and your mom took the kids...

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.559
to a friend's house.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.560
He told you not to worry.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.079
Where is his wound?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.080
It's here.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.920
The bullet is deep inside.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400
If we don't take it out,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.479
the inflammation and high fever...

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.039
will kill him.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040
Then hurry up.

00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:50.360
Take the bullet out for him.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.799
Do you know...

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.279
that Qi Chang Rong and his men...

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.840
are looking for your husband
everywhere?

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.120
How did you provoke him?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.440
Wei did it for us.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.319
Mr. Peng, I'm at my wit's end.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.840
I beg you, Mr. Peng. Hurry.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.160
Please save my husband first.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.080
Your mom helped me before.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.960
Consider it me returning the favor.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.560
Find him for me. Alive.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.199
Mr. Qi.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.519
The hospital said Big Dog is dead.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.560
He couldn't be saved.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.160
I knew there was something wrong
with that call.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.440
He wasn't the deliveryman at all.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.000
This wasn't an accident.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.639
That scoundrel, Cao Wei Er,

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.280
wanted to blow me up too.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.199
We've searched everywhere.
There's no one.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.559
He must have run away.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.599
Mr. Qi, didn't the news say...

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.559
the robber of the transport van
was injured and escaped?

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.600
He couldn't have gone far.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.080
The police are looking for him
everywhere.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.400
He's too injured
to go to the hospital.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.439
Spread the word.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.439
Any black-market doctor
who dares to help Cao Wei Er...

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.839
will end up being buried
alongside him!

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.880
Yes, Mr. Qi.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.759
Here. Press on the wound.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.160
I need to stitch it up immediately.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.200
Hurry up!

00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:42.920
Do you want him to bleed to death?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.680
Let go!

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.599
You need to be composed
for the interview.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600
Pick the red one.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.120
When you become the Chief Justice,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.760
wear the gray one.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.640
Do you like it?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.680
Do you want me
to pick another one for you?

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.440
His fever seems to have gone down.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.920
He'll be fine after a few more days
of rest.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.400
Thank you, Mr. Peng.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.600
Wei, can you hear me?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320
You'll be fine.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.560
We'll be fine.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.280
Mr. Peng.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760
Here.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.560
Who do you think I am?

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.800
Thank you, Mr. Peng.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.520
He's bleeding so much.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.440
Buy him some nourishing food.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.199
Well,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.439
Mr. Peng, please,

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.320
can you take care of him
for a little while?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.959
I'm going out to buy him something.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.840
I'm also going to visit my children.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.680
Please.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.360
I can only stay for a while.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.919
I have patients waiting for me
at the clinic this afternoon.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.279
Okay, I'll be quick.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.359
- I'll be quick.
- As soon as possible.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.720
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Peng.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.840
Judge Qin.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.399
I didn't see you just now.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.240
I was so worried something
might happen to you.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.839
Thank you for your concern.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.440
I did very well at the interview.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.639
I don't know why, but I have...

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.640
a very good feeling.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.559
I thought you'd come to your senses.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.759
Go back to your seat,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.200
and stop making trouble
for yourself.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.800
Thank you for your concern.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.560
Well, good luck.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.399
Since my first day as a judge,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.440
I've asked myself,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
is conviction...

00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:23.760
the only way to uphold the law?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.600
There's data that shows...

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.040
judges who graduated
from prosecution...

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.640
have a high conviction rate.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.479
This tendency to convict...

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.480
is most likely caused...

00:15:33.481 --> 00:15:36.040
by their prolonged prosecution work.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800
Sometimes,

00:15:37.801 --> 00:15:39.400
they don't even notice it
themselves.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.199
As for me,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.639
I've only been
in the Prosecutor's Office...

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640
for half a year.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.039
Judge Qin, are you saying...

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.280
that if you were the Chief Justice,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.959
you might be able to be...

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.680
more objective and impartial
in your trial?

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.439
That would be your strength, right?

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.879
I don't think the Chief Justice...

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.120
should pursue conviction rates,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.400
but judicial justice.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.280
Do you still remember...

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.840
Ding Kai Yi's case...

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.400
from a year ago?

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440
Yes.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.519
That was a case
of accidental killing.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.960
You only attended court twice,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.840
but you suddenly asked
to be replaced.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.559
Because of that,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.159
the case had to be reopened.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.199
It cost the government money...

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.639
and was a waste of time.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.199
Can you explain...

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.440
why you did that?

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800
Because the defendant...

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.600
looked very much like my wife.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.120
Even the way they talked and acted.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.279
I was worried
that I wouldn't be able...

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.999
to set aside my prejudice...

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.560
and make a fair ruling
on the defendant.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.520
Because at that moment,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.960
my wife passed away
less than a month ago.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.560
I know what I did wasn't perfect.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.360
- But...
- Didn't you think...

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.160
what you did was perfect?

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760
Ma Shan Bao.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.680
Cao Wei Er.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.439
How many inappropriate
and unfair things have you done?

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.440
Have you ever...

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280
felt guilty?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.400
Have you ever blamed yourself?

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.359
Can you even fall asleep...

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.560
at night?

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.279
What...

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280
What did you say?

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.240
I mean,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.120
I agree with what you did.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.839
Nothing is perfect in this world.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.640
Humans are not machines.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.159
I believe...

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.760
if I were you back then,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.440
I would have done the same.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.719
Can you explain...

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.040
why you did it?

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.240
Because the defendant...

00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:27.960
looks very much like my wife.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.920
Let me ask you.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.640
What sound does a whale make?

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.080
The number you have dialed
is unavailable.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.239
Because of you,
I've lost two brothers...

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.760
who had been with me
for over a decade.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.839
What you really want...

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.399
is my life, Qi Chang Rong.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.400
Am I right?

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840
Wei Wei.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720
Wei Wei.

00:20:53.721 --> 00:20:55.360
Open the door. It's Grandma.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640
Wei Wei.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.640
I want to talk to you.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.480
You don't have school, right?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.639
Wei Wei.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.680
I know.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.080
I was too nervous in the past.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.679
I just don't want anything bad...

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.440
to happen to our family again.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.559
Your dad and I fight all the time.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.359
It's troublesome for you too.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.599
Then I promise you,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.400
I will be careful about this
in the future.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.200
Wei Wei.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.280
Say something back to me.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.360
I don't have anything to say.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.640
Do you recognize this necklace?

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080
Yes.

00:22:09.081 --> 00:22:11.399
I gave this necklace to your mom...

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.960
as a gift three years ago.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.800
The circle symbolizes completeness.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.680
After your mom passed away,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.080
your dad couldn't find it anywhere.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.680
So you gave it to Coach Yu.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.920
Then, she gave it back to me.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.080
Where did you find this necklace?

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.160
Why didn't you tell your dad?

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.120
Wei Wei.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.999
- Hey.
- Young Master Lie.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.079
What has happened?

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.080
I don't know why.

00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:24.841
Young Master Gang
suddenly becomes like this.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.719
What's wrong with him?

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720
He was fine before.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.799
He's having an epileptic seizure.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.279
It could be a side effect...

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.520
from a severe blow to the head.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.079
We are going
to give him a sedative now...

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.160
to calm him down.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.080
We'll check on him later.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200
Let's talk.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.680
If it's about your brother,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.599
the doctor said...

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.719
he has a brain injury.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.120
Recovery will be a long process.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.599
It's not about my brother.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600
It's about your sister.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.280
My sister?

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400
What about my sister?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.160
The police said she's on leave.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.160
She won't answer my calls.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.400
She was forced to be on leave
because of you.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.759
My sister is a police officer.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.520
She can't be involved with you.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.280
I didn't want to get involved
with her.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560
If it's because of me...

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.736
that your sister was forced
to take leave,

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.800
I'm sorry.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.640
But I have something to ask her.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.079
My sister has nothing to say to you.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.519
Whether she does or not,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520
it's up to me.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.880
What do you mean?

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.519
The Internal Investigations Unit
of the police department...

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.639
has summoned me for questioning.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.720
I think it's about your sister.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.200
My sister has nothing to do
with you.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.119
Whether she does or not,

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120
it depends on what I say.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.600
What do you want?

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800
Tell her.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.280
My brother woke up.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.840
He saw the culprit.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.840
Tang Xuan was forced to take leave.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.680
This is what you wanted?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.840
Isn't this what you want too?

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.480
She hid evidence.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.560
It's unfair to those involved.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.399
You're always so condescending,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.960
speaking with such
self-righteousness.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.960
If you called me here this time...

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.839
for nothing else...

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.640
You took advantage of those
who trusted you...

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.400
and implicated the innocent
around you.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.640
Don't you feel guilty at all?

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280
Wei.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040
Wei.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840
Wei.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.960
Wei!

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.080
I never thought things
would turn out this way.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.480
I don't want to talk about the past.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.839
But from the first day...

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.120
I asked you to help Ma Shan Bao,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.720
I sincerely wanted you to help him.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.880
But now Ma Shan Bao
became a scapegoat...

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.720
because of my fault.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.520
It's not your fault.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.640
Your only mistake...

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.240
was trusting me.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.960
Let it go.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.040
You can start over.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.000
Hello, are you off work yet?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I'm Han Lie.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.640
Just get to the point.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120
My brother woke up.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.999
The person I drew
might be the culprit.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
You'd better hurry.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.560
I'll wait for your good news.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.400
Thank you.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.760
My sister is a good cop.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.880
From now on, keep your distance
from Han Lie.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.840
Don't get involved in this anymore.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.800
He meant to give me that watch.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.840
He didn't mean to cause you trouble.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.879
I know.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.120
He's not the one who framed me.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.279
- Well...
- Just keep your distance from him.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.400
Do you hear what I'm saying?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.279
Well...

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.679
Now, whether it's voluntary
or forced,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.840
you're on leave.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.799
How about I take a few days off...

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800
and travel with you?

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.760
I still have things to do.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.400
I'll take you home first.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.040
I have to see Officer Shi.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.920
So that's what you're up to.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.520
Man before sister, huh?

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.280
Inspector Tang.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.680
How can you call this
being on leave?

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.519
You want to move
your whole office...

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.840
to my place?

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.839
I've finally figured out...

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.400
the whole case.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880
I hope you can be objective...

00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:53.199
and listen to me again.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.599
Let's see if my deduction is right.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.679
Inspector Tang,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.120
I just got off work.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720
I'll get going then.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.840
You don't have to do that.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.319
That's a lot of writing.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320
Are your hands tired?

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.320
I'll carry it for you.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.679
It's like a dense spiderweb.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.320
Why is it so complicated?

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.280
Han Kui Long.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.279
Just by the name,
I know he's no good.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.560
Han, Kui, and Long.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.559
Hello.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.039
Judge Qin, this is Lu Wei De.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.040
I heard...

00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:42.999
you did well in the interview.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Congratulations.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.799
What can I do for you?

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.159
I received a letter.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.999
It says that about half a year ago,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.319
you were questioned by the police.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.319
That was
when your wife committed suicide.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.280
The police found you suspicious...

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.160
and investigated you.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.440
You're trying so hard to find dirt
on me.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.800
Do you want me to withdraw
from the election?

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.319
The police were just conducting
a routine investigation.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.960
I've been proven innocent.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.159
Now, the point isn't...

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.479
whether you're innocent or not.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.719
The point is...

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.400
you were suspected.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.919
A candidate for Chief Justice...

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.999
is actually...

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.680
a suspect in his wife's murder.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.320
I won't withdraw
because of your threats.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.199
If that's the case,

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.000
I'll give this letter to the media.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800
Okay.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.839
Mr. Peng, where's Wei?

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.840
Where is he?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.359
I saved him.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.640
I've done my best, right?

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.799
As for the rest,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.000
go to Qi Chang Rong.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.840
Did you betray me?

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.759
You have a husband and children.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.359
I have a wife and children too.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.560
I have to protect them.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.919
Of all people to offend,

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.560
you had to offend that living devil.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.960
To stop me from taking his son...

00:32:03.961 --> 00:32:05.641
back to the police station
for questioning,

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.080
Qin Yu framed me for having ties
to the gangsters...

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.839
because he was near my house
that very night.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.840
He's the most likely person...

00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:13.120
to see me meeting Han Lie.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.639
Then,

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.719
he took advantage of Zhou Luo Wen's
prejudice against me...

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720
and got her to file a complaint
against me...

00:32:17.721 --> 00:32:18.959
with the Complaints Department.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.999
Then he lied to me...

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
and gave a false statement.

00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:23.119
He used Zhou Luo Wen
to obstruct justice.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.359
There's only one reason
why he did what he did.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.239
It was to protect his son.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.799
He knew right from the start...

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.479
that his son
was the hit-and-run driver...

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.720
who struck and injured someone.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.599
A word of advice for you.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.960
Hit the snake where it hurts most.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.800
You must strike with precision.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.799
You must find
irrefutable evidence...

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.000
that Qin Yiwei fled the scene
after the accident.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
And Tang Xuan,

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.160
you...

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.399
have to protect yourself.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.280
You don't have to get yourself
involved in this.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.479
According to our reporter,

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.159
Candidate for Chief Justice
of the District Court,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.279
Judge Qin Yu,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.959
was investigated by police
and questioned...

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.799
over his suspected involvement
in his wife's suicide case...

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.080
more than half a year ago.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480
Judge Qin.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.039
You saw the news.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.519
Please don't blame me.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.520
Citizens...

00:33:23.521 --> 00:33:24.680
also have the right to know.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.600
You'll be the Chief Justice
for sure. Congratulations.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.840
We have to wait
for the official announcement.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.120
There's no need.
Who else could it be but you?

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.359
It's okay for you to talk about me.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360
Don't talk about my wife.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Also,

00:33:45.001 --> 00:33:47.359
The last time my car was inspected
by the police,

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.800
you took that photo, didn't you?

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.800
Was it you?

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.479
It was me.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.759
I might not be a good person.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.480
But you must be a rotten person.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.400
Yi Wei.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.120
What is it, Dad?

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.440
Think carefully.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.880
When you hit Han Gang,

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.440
did you get out of the car?

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.680
I walked over to him.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.800
I saw blood all over his face.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.439
I was so scared
that I had an asthma attack...

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.440
and threw up.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.479
Then I went back to the car...

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.760
to get the inhaler.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.520
You threw up?

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.440
Yes.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.120
Why didn't you tell me?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.040
I don't remember,
but what does it matter?

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.280
Because the police
found an inhaler...

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.720
at the crime scene.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.760
It had your DNA on it.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.519
If they compare the DNA
from the asthma inhaler...

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.880
- to the vomit...
- But...

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.679
my name is not on the inhaler.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.920
How did they know it was me?

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.400
Someone went through our trash
this morning.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.159
In the trash,

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.079
there was your asthma inhaler.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.400
Your DNA was in it.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.799
If they compare these three things,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800
they can prove...

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.600
that you were at the scene.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.720
Get off the car.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.560
Wei.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.440
I'm so sad.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.520
Do you know why?

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.920
It's not because you blew up my men.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.200
It's not because I was arrested
by the police.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.919
It's not even because Han Lie...

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.520
tried to ruin my businesses.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.320
I'm sad because of you.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.559
You swore
on your children's lives...

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.720
to help me get the firearms.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.120
But you didn't keep your promise.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.400
What kind of a jerk dad are you?

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.320
I didn't lie to you.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.599
I helped you rob the firearms.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.119
Who planted the bomb in the car...

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120
to kill me?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.400
It was either you or the guy
who delivered the goods for you.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.799
Who is he?

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.800
Should I find him...

00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:25.040
and settle this with him?

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.800
Who is he?

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720
Hold him down.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.440
Are you going to talk now?

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.199
Do I have to cripple
your other hand...

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200
before you'll talk?

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.640
Qi Chang Rong.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.960
I know you won't let me go.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.040
Let's get this over with.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.440
As an ex-cop, you're different.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.000
You've got guts.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.959
But I wonder if your precious son...

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.200
is as tough as you.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.680
Maybe we can try.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.560
Qi Chang Rong.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.520
You swore...

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.759
you'd keep my wife
and children safe.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.040
Don't touch them.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.959
Cao Wei Er.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.320
You're the one who swore
on your children's lives.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.400
Who do you think God will listen to?

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.199
Young Master Lie.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.399
It's Qi Changrong's man.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.960
We've searched him
and found no weapons.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.680
Mr. Qi wants to have a word
with Young Master Lie.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.960
Han Lie.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.760
I'd like to sit down
and talk with you.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.480
What's there to talk about?

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.359
Do you want to surrender?

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.760
You'll know when you get here.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.199
Or are you too timid...

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.480
to come and see me?

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.280
I'll tell you the location later.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.879
Senior, do you remember...

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.599
the last time you helped me
do a DNA test on an inhaler?

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.719
Yes.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.640
There were also some samples
of vomit.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.599
I suspect this one belongs
to the same person.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.319
I'd like you to help me get
a DNA comparison test done.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.479
You're not going to tell me...

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.000
where these samples came from,
are you?

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.759
You're so smart, senior.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.879
All right. I'll get it tested for
you as soon as possible.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.919
Thank you.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.960
Let me know the results.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.520
Put the gun away.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.960
Get off the car.
I have a big gift for you.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.680
Come here.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.480
You don't know this guy, do you?

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.480
Introduce yourself
to Young Master Lie.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.159
His name is Cao Wei Er.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.240
He used to be a cop.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.760
After he was fired,

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.280
he became a smuggler.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.760
You didn't ask me out...

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.480
just to introduce me
to a friend, did you?

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.440
I heard your brother woke up.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.079
He finally snatched his life back...

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.120
from the King of Hell.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.799
I guess you don't know...

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.240
the truth
about your brother's crash.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.600
But he does.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.040
Say it.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.480
Wake up!

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.480
Tell us who did it.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.600
It was Qin Yu.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.680
You mean the judge?

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.279
Yes, it was his son...

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.880
who hit your brother.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.640
You killed Ma Shan Bao...

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.719
and splashed hot oil...

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.279
on my man, Da Xiong.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.359
How are we going to settle this?

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.600
You burned my men too.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.479
You also stole those guns...

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.799
and the explosives
that almost killed you.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.160
I'm not the one who wanted war.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.199
Don't think that just because
you sent this guy to me,

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.560
I'll pretend nothing happened.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.079
I'll settle this score with you
sooner or later.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.080
But not today.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.840
At least I won't be
taken advantage of.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.440
The matter with your brother
has been cleared up.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.599
It has nothing to do
with the Old City Gang.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.839
As for the rest,

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.880
we'll settle it later.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.039
Besides,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.560
what are you going to do
with this guy?

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.040
It's up to you.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.520
Qi Chang Rong.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.920
Don't forget.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.040
You swore in front of Guan Yu...

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.400
to keep my wife and children safe.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.880
If you go back on your word,

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.000
you'll be struck by lightning.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.720
I want to talk to you.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.096
I'm the one who filed the complaint
against you.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.120
I know.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.839
If you do this,

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.360
I can also file a complaint
against you for harassing a witness.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.319
I didn't specifically
come here to see you.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.679
I was just waiting for someone.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.360
And you just happened
to see me after work.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.840
What do you want to say?

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.880
I know Ma Shan Bao
was not the culprit.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.679
You finally admit that...

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.880
you arrested the wrong person.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.479
Yes.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.720
We did arrest the wrong person.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.199
But that's because
someone around us...

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.680
has been deliberately misleading us.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.959
When I say "us",

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.680
I mean me and you.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.959
If you want to do justice
to Ma Shan Bao,

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.999
you should step forward
and testify against the person...

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.880
who made Ma Shan Bao a scapegoat.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.400
Looks like you already knew.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.400
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.600
That's not important.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.479
What's important is...

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.240
I've got the answer I wanted.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.879
Just watch me...

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.719
bring the real culprit to justice...

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.480
and give Ma Shan Bao
the justice he deserved.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.279
Isn't this...

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.240
what you've always wanted?
