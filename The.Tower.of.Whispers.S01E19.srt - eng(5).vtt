[The Tower of Whispers]

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.370
[Episode 19]

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.590
Jun Che.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.840
What happened?

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.840
Did you kill them?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.280
I'm asking you.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.870
Did you kill them?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.120
Yes, I killed them. So what?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.030
Didn't you promise me that

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.030
you wouldn't kill
the innocent anymore?

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.870
Innocent?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.870
None of them are innocent.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.470
They all deserved to die.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.360
Does it hurt?

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.000
It's my fault.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.000
I shouldn't have killed them.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.530
But when I saw these people,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.710
I remembered my childhood.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.370
They pinned me down in the snow

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.470
and humiliated me.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.030
Five.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.000
Five.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.120
I understand.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.000
They were all evil men

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.800
who worked for the Eldest Prince.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.040
They deserved to die.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.560
But they are not worth

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.870
having your hands stained
with their blood.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.720
They...

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.750
None of them are worth it.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.750
Five.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.870
Let me ask you.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.870
Does killing people really make you happy?

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.680
No.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.630
You'll only suffer more.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.220
Promise me.
Don't go on killing sprees anymore.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.680
Don't take out your anger on others

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.630
because of these evil men.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.270
Okay?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.070
I didn't expect that she managed

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.600
to calm Jun Che down
with just a few words.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.070
She seems to matter a lot to His Majesty.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.510
Since Lu Yingying is his cure,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.510
I'll turn her

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.920
into his poison.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.120
You're here.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.430
Yingying.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.220
You're beautiful.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.130
What happened?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.240
Nothing.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.950
Have you been too tired lately?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.360
He's tired

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.600
but I'm not.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.190
Yingying.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.070
You're so beautiful.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.430
What happened?

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.870
What's wrong?

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.430
Why don't you rest for a while?

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.230
I'll pour you some soothing tea.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.370
Have a rest now!

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480
Kill him.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.160
Then, we can be together, Yingying.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.950
Five.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.480
What on earth is the matter with you?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.680
Speak!

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.950
Push him away!

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.950
Kill him!

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.920
You love me.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.430
Let's run away together.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.430
You don't love him.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.000
You only love me.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.680
Let me go!

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.159
I'll never let you go.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.800
You will always belong only to me!

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.560
Miss.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.600
Is that you?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.720
I'll be able to see you soon.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.050
Thank you, Miss.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.350
Is this your silk handkerchief?

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.400
The fragrance is distinctive.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.669
I made this scent with ambergris.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.150
It's unique.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.450
The fragrance suits its owner.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.000
Although I'm blind

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.080
at the moment,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.840
I can sense that

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.030
this fragrance

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.910
is unique and elegant

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.650
like your temperament.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.000
Elegant?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.790
I'm afraid I'll let you down then.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.240
Thanks to your attentive care these days,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.870
my eyes are healing fast.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.790
My gratitude is beyond words.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.030
I owed you a wish.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.320
Have you decided what you want?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.440
For such a great favor,
words aren't enough.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.000
I want you to marry me.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.480
I will not

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.080
disappoint you.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.890
After my eyes recover,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.690
I will marry you
with a grand wedding procession.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.410
Take this as my pledge.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.670
Miss.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.080
He is an idiot.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.790
If he knew I'm the healer,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.670
he would be angry again.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.600
Push him away! Kill him!

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.600
You love me.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.030
Let's run away together.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.200
Your Majesty.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.750
According to ancestral customs,

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.720
within a month
of a new emperor's ascension,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.360
the Heaven Worship Ritual must be held.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.550
Before the ritual,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.870
the imperial astronomer must perform
divination ceremonies for Your Majesty.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.030
According to my divination,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.840
Your Majesty has recently been

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.360
troubled,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.320
making you distraught.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.830
If this continues,
it will impact the nation's fortunes.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.320
What should I do?

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.790
There is one solution.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.720
The key lies in what to offer

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.390
during the Heaven Worship Ritual.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.080
It's not proper to offer livestock

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.080
nor fruits.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.770
Then what should I use?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.080
The lives of 100,000 Daning people.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.240
[Taiji Hall]

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.080
Bring in the envoy from Yue State.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.080
Che, why are you in such a hurry
to see me?

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.130
What happened?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.790
This sorcerer said

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.030
that I should sacrifice
100,000 Daning people

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.680
to ensure the prosperity of our nation.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.600
I'd like to

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.050
ask your opinion on this solution.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.770
Though many people will be killed,

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.630
it seems worth it

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.730
for the fortunes of our nation.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.480
Really?

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.000
Che, you...

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.800
Mother, you're really capable.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.390
You even colluded

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.200
with the imperial astronomer of Daning.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.370
How could you...

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:28.670
Yingying.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.630
I didn't mean to.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.600
Five.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.360
I'm afraid I'll hurt you again.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.480
You became like this

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.960
after meeting your mother.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.150
Think carefully.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.770
Did she do something to you?

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.550
Hurry up!

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.480
Avenge your grievances!

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.390
Kill them, Che!

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.510
I won't let her succeed.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960
Stop pretending.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.100
You poisoned me

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.960
and colluded with the imperial astronomer.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.360
Mother, do you think

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.480
you can be

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.720
the controller of Daning?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.320
Stop dreaming.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.940
Do you think
there's anything I wouldn't do?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.360
I can kill you easily.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.150
Guards!

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.840
Take her away

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.080
and put her in jail.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.670
Yes.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.300
Do you really think
all that was an illusion?

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.360
Don't forget that

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.600
eyes may deceive you

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.270
but hands won't.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.200
Why don't you touch it yourself?

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.390
[Taiji Hall]

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.130
This is an illusion.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.180
I won't be controlled by you anymore.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.360
It's not an illusion?
