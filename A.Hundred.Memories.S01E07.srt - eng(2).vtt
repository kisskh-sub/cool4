No, let me.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.320
Would you like some water, Father?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.950
No. It will make me feel full.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.130
How about a beverage, then?

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.240
Beverages are water, too.

Don't make me repeat myself.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.600
Anyway, it feels too stuffy in here.

- Father, please.

Here. Should I cut your hair shorter?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.740
I think I could, since you have
a nicely shaped head.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.710
No. I should stop for the day.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.590
So, I could visit you again. Right?

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.350
Why bother keep visiting an old, sick man?

Okay, Ahjussi. Try this.

Gosh. These women.

They asked all sorts of
questions as if they'd buy.

But they said they'll buy later.

He doesn't like the barbershop at the hospital.

Okay, fine, girl. I'll do it. I'll do.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.200
Geez. What an annoying woman. She's so uppity.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.200
She only talks as if she cares about me.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.130
So, when is Jeong Hyeon coming?

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.660
This weekend, I guess.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.440
Yeong Sik said he won't come until next year.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.040
He must be coming all of a sudden.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.600
I'd be happy if I were her, too.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.460
He's their only child, you know.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.440
What's this, Unni?

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.010
Are you defending her, not me?

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.500
Because her son is Yeong Sik's friend?

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.570
I'm not taking sides. It's not
like I don't know them.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.180
Of course, you are.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.070
You know I'm insecure since
our business failed, right?

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.920
I get disappointed over little things.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.900
Come on. Be on my side. Come on.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.240
Come on. Be on my side. Right now.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.360
Yes, you're right. Rich people are worse.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.310
Buying a cream would be nothing to her.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.990
She should've bought it first
before taking care of her son.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.530
What a lousy woman.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.540
I hope she trips while walking.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.570
Are you happy?

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.680
I am. I am.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.010
Gosh, I'd rather die. Seriously.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:26.090
I must've sinned in my previous life.
How did we become friends?

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.870
Gosh. I'm so sick of it.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:35.040
By the way, human connections are so funny.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.380
Because Jeong Hyeon introduced Yeong Sik to us,

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.570
Yeong Sik became Jae Pil's tutor.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:44.150
And thanks to that, Jae Pil got
into medical school.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:49.080
He seems to be born to be a doctor, Unni.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.900
Sunbae!

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.420
Guys.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.580
What? Why are you freaking out now?

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.250
Did the sky fall?

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.910
Or did we get a ton of patients?

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.510
No, it's not that.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.410
You know the Medical Students' Night this week?

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.510
Yes.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.170
They charge you a huge fee if you
don't bring a date. Is that true?

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.310
I see. Chang Eui must be freaking out again.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.940
There weren't any fees, right?

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.540
I know.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:31.160
I'm in trouble. I'm already running
low on money this month.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.860
Good luck.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.410
Geez.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.170
- Eat.
- Okay.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.837
Han Jae Pil, you know that friend of yours?

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:56.710
- Who?
- The one who comes to cut your father's hair.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.400
She's just a friend, right?

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.990
Introduce me. She's totally my type.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.270
I'll treat you generously if it works out.

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.270
I'll get you beef, not pork. How does that sound?

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.780
I can't.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.720
Even tiger meat won't do.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.990
Why? Why not?

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.450
You said she's not your girlfriend.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.590
Don't just say no and tell me why.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.080
Anyway, I can't.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.920
I don't want to.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:07.140
Gosh. No. Things would just get awkward.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.770
Wake up. Wake up.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.300
"Rose Day is just around the corner.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.710
Would I be able to express my feelings this time?

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.080
I hope I'll be able to. Here's my song request."

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.680
Shin Jeong Hui from Hongje-dong
sent this message.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.750
Here's her requested song.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.760
"Susanne" by Kim Seung Jin.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.690
Gosh. How amazing.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.510
How can someone have a voice like that?

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.830
Gosh, hot!

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:59.840
Be careful. You're about to burn all of my hair.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.900
Gosh. I told you to practice with a wig.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.620
I'm so scared.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.340
Wigs are nothing like real hair.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.330
And I bought you that pastry for being my model.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:15.000
Sit still. Stop being annoying.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.630
I'm back.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.380
- Hey.
- Hey, Unni.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.530
I smell something burnt.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.530
I told you. You burned all of my hair.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.190
Gosh. You drive me crazy, Unni.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.010
It didn't burn. Not at all.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.960
It didn't burn at all. Look.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.820
Smell it. It didn't. You look pretty
like Marie Antoinette.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.230
It smells like it burned.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.550
I swear it didn't burn.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.800
I'll answer it.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.360
- Do a better job, okay?
- It didn't burn. Really.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.150
Hello?

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.950
Hey, Jae Pil.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.810
You were home.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.480
I wondered if I should call later.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.660
I just got home.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.490
What made you call at this hour?

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.080
Shouldn't you be busy right now?

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.780
I was. I was really busy.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.560
There was an accident at a construction site.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.750
I'm finally catching a breath now.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.310
You must be exhausted.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.740
Well,

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.190
are you free this Sunday?

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:19.530
Yes. The hair salon is closed
on the second Sunday. Why?

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:21.400
It's nothing much.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.830
There's this Medical Students' Night.
It's an annual event.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:31.420
They charge a fine if I don't bring a date.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:38.290
I was wondering if you could come with me.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.210
A date?

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.980
Well, I don't mind.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.040
But are you sure I can come?

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.110
Okay. I'll go, then.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.900
Yes, yes. I know that hotel.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.070
Okay. I'll see you at the entrance.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.470
Okay, okay. Bye.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.810
Date? What date?

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.330
- Jae Pil asked you to be your date?
- Date?

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.780
Come on and tell us.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.670
Come on! I'm dying to know.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:21.140
There's an event called the Medical
Students' Night or whatever.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.830
He asked me to come since there'll be
a fine if he doesn't bring a date.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.190
- Unni!
- It's happening. It's happening.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.810
You think he called you because of a fine?

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.490
He's definitely confessing his love.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:33.340
He finally made up his mind.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.700
It's a love confession. It has to be.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.250
Unni, Unni. Stay alert and listen.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.130
This is your moment.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.060
You can't mess this up.
You know what I mean, right?

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.870
My moment, my foot. Stop freaking out.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.340
Hey, Ko Yeong Rye. Ko Yeong Rye.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.450

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.840
Do something. Seriously.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.900
You'll be a fool to miss this chance.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.770
- Come on-
- Stop, stop. Stop.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.070
That's enough.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:05.100
Well, I... We just think you make a nice couple.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.370
Yes. We thought it was such a shame.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.300
I know. I do, but...

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.560
I can manage my dating life. So, be quiet.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.010
Of course it is.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.240
I'm asking because it's you.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.060
"Because it's you..."

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.560
"Because it's you..."

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.290
What does that mean?

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.640
Because he feels comfortable with me?

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.550
Because we're close?

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.380
If not, because...

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.480
Because he likes me?

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.840
Ma'am, hold on! Hold on.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.630
Hold on.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.590

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.610

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.590
Hi, Mr. Jeong. Have you been well?

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.960
I just got into the car, Mother.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.540
I see. You must be tired.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.060
Be careful and take your time. Hurry up.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.950
Is it because I haven't heard Korean in a while?

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:22.320
I don't know how to be careful,
take my time, and hurry up.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.730
I'll stop by somewhere first, Mother.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:28.150
I know you miss me, but please wait a bit.

[Court]

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:30.800
Witness Jang Yeon Hui, who will prove
[Judge]

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.860
the defendant's alibi doesn't
remember being with the

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.730
defendant at the time of the crime.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:41.830
It's hard to accept the defendant's
statement based on what the witness said.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:44.680
On the other hand, the statement from
Kim Yeong Su, the victim and the witness

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.170
has been consistent since he talked to the police.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.330
For these reasons,

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.760
Kim Yeong Su's statement is highly credible

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:58.360
and it's very unlikely that the
defendant isn't the culprit.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.490
The defendant's indictment

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:03.860
was determined by solid evidence

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.450
that leaves me with no reasonable doubt.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:11.690
Therefore, I reached the following ruling.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:16.360
The defendant will face a fine of two million won.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.830
Trainee Ko Yeong Sik,

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:31.240
could you tell us more about
why you found the defendant guilty?

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.420
According to the Principle of Adjudication
Based on Evidence in Criminal Law,

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.800
a crime must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:45.990
In this case, the defense's witness
couldn't prove the defendant's alibi

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:50.630
and the prosecution's witness,
the victim's statement was highly credible.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:53.380
I decided based on that.

Good. All right.

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.410
A witness's statement isn't solid evidence,

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:04.060
but if the judge was left with no reasonable doubt

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.930
since the statement seemed highly credible,

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.610
it can become important evidence for a ruling.

Yes. It was going to happen, anyway.
Good thinking.

Why don't you date, by the way?

I could tell that the smart young lady

No, I don't.

I'd feel more comfortable if you stayed ugly.

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.170
Oppa, when did you come to Korea?

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.120
I didn't hear that you were back.

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:50.190
Today. I wanted to have Mother's
soybean paste stew first.

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:55.690
Wow, Jae Pil. Long time no see.

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:59.750
Wow. You're starting to look like a doctor.

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.130
Have you been well?

00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:04.830
It's so nice to run into you.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.770
- Another bottle, please.
- Okay.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:26.790
Yeong Rye's friend told me earlier.

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:28.910
I heard you guys went to the
Medical Students' Night.

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:31.800
I guess you don't have a girlfriend
since you brought Yeong Rye.

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.510
Well, no.

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.870
But you should've taken good care of her.

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:41.700
Why did you let her sprain her ankle?

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.270
How's that Jae Pil's fault?

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:45.800
It's because she was clumsy.

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.670
I suppose. That's her charm, right?

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:54.260
Unpolished, you know?

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.790
I missed Yeong Rye. That was too brief.

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:05.010
Should I bring her back here?

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.200
I can carry her myself.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.350
She can't drink right now.

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:11.820
Because of the inflammation.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.710
Really?

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:18.350
I have nothing to say since
it's coming from a doctor.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.550
Thank you.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.250
Enjoy.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.800
- Another bottle, please.
- Okay.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.610
Just give us two bottles.

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:11.050
Okay.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:39.670
Geez, man. So...

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.730
you shouldn't have even tried.

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.910
Excuse me.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.690
This is "Awake in the Night."

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:10.750
We got a letter from one of our regulars.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:14.020
Our listeners cheer for this person, too.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.600
It's Ms. K from Dodam-dong.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.400
Let's hear her story.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.120
I heard there's such a thing as a Rose Day

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.220
for the first time today.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:29.340
You're supposed to confess your love
to someone by giving them roses.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.890
I couldn't muster the courage on Valentine's Day,

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:34.240
but I'll try this time.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.250
I'm worried things might get awkward between us,

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.680
but I'll no longer ignore my feelings

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.200
that I've had for a long time.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.510
She requested Yu Jae Ha's "Love On My Heart."

01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:52.230
I'm so curious about how it'd go.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.610
If her love confession worked out,

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:57.670
she might not be listening to this right now.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:59.710
I hope that's the case.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:01.810
Let's listen to the song now.

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:05.412
Yu Jae Ha's "Love On My Heart."

01:04:05.412 --> 01:04:12.552
♫ The pieces of the dream that
can't be put back together ♫

01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:17.220
♫ They're going missing one by one ♫

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:24.400
My love confession failed since
I missed the right timing-

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.550
♫ Wandering endlessly ♫

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:36.300
♫ I'm hanging in there today, too ♫

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.620
What?

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.960
What's wrong with them? What happened?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.730
I don't know.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:45.560
I almost died carrying these two drunken men.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.670
Gosh, these bastards.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:50.350
What? Where am I?

01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:52.730
It's too dark.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.120
How funny.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.200
You don't know someone until they're drunk.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.150
Now that they're drunk, the one
who studied abroad or the doctor

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.830
aren't so different. Don't you agree?

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.440
I know.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.100
I really thought he was cool.

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:12.010
But this is a bit disappointing.

01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:13.830
Geez.

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:20.300
Huh? Gosh.

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:30.340
Hey, move.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.710
My arm hurts.

01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:40.410
Hey, hey. I have a cramp. Don't move.

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:45.470
Who are these men?

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:47.770
Why are they sleeping in our house?

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:51.240
Gosh, I know. Why here?

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.300
Hi, guys.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.460
Mom wants you to come down and eat.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.590
Both of you.

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.760
Hey, cure your hangover.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.470
We're here.

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:25.290
You came.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.750
What are you doing? Have a seat.

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:33.970
Okay. Dried pollack soup? You're the best, Mother.

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:37.970
Thank you.

01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:40.470
What happened to you?

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:42.540
Don't know. I'm dying.

01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:52.810
Okay. Let's eat.

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.100
Thank you for the meal!

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.900
Whoa...

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.060
You've been consumed by alcohol. Totally.

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:09.220
It's painful and embarrassing, isn't it?

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.740
And you have nothing to say with your big mouth.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.680
I know.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:18.430
I haven't had soju in a while. It tasted so sweet.

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.940
I'm sorry.

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.480
Gosh. It's fine. Just eat and go.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.970
Jae Pil, don't you have
to go back to the hospital?

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:28.330
Well, yes. I have some time today.

01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:30.870
We can go in late today because
of the event last night.

01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:36.340
So, you want to eat lunch and dinner here, too?

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.130
No, no. It's not that.

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:40.480
Gosh. What's with this jangjorim*?
(Beef braised in soy sauce)

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.140
It's so delicious. Wow.

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:47.120
Yeong Rye, eat this. It's a big piece.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.410
Jae Pil! Jae Pil!

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:56.870
I heard... I heard you got drunk
and passed out here.

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:00.940
Hello, Mother.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.170
That silly guy.

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:15.340
Wow. You're unbelievable, Han Jae Pil.

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.840
You don't even drink much. Why...

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.900
Was it Jeong Hyeon? I heard you had
a drinking competition with him.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:27.360
Why did you suddenly get
competitive? It's unlike you.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.230
Let's drive quietly. You're annoying me.

01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:34.340
I don't want to. I'll make fun of you
for the rest of your life.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.340
I'll get off.

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.280
Hey, hey. Okay, okay, okay.

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.070
Okay, okay, okay.

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:42.180
Okay, okay.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.260
You said you'll stop by home, right?

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.840
- I'll drop you off on the main street.
- Okay.

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:56.160
I heard there was an event at your school.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.110
Ho Suk freaked out about you
inviting Yeong Rye there.

01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:04.080
What? About what?

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.480
What do you think?

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.750
You're neither friends nor
a couple with Yeong Rye.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.070
It's such an awkward relationship.

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:17.200
That's why everyone's freaking out.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.590
Let's hear how you actually feel.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:24.850
What is Yeong Rye to you?

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:29.000
Hey, hold on. I have the right to ask this.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.720
You know she was my first love, right?

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.230
How could I not know? You let everyone know.

01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:35.110
That's what I'm saying.

01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:36.940
How do you really feel?

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:40.650
She's just a friend to you?

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.540
No.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.630
No? Right.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:56.380
No? H-Hey, did you say, "No" just now?

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.270
How do you feel about her, then-

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:01.580
Hey, don't let go of this!

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.590
- This is a steering wheel.
- Okay.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.270
Geez. Are you crazy?

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:08.380
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.780
So, what is Yeong Rye to you?

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:17.840
Is she more than a friend?

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.250
I asked what she means to you!

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.700
Hello.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.740
Hello.

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:30.040
Is something going on? What's happening?

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.160
We're expecting a VVIP customer today.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.870
But she's bringing her daughter, too.

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.550
The owner is extra irritable today.

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:41.460
Hey, don't put the planter
in the front. Put it over there.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.740
Hello.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.330
Yeong Rye, what are you doing?
Get changed and help.

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:47.050
- Okay.
- Where's Choi Jeong Bun?

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:48.420
She's off today.

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.070
Go.

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:53.050
Hey, put the mop inside!

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.980
Nothing's better than sweet coffee in the morning.

01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.040
Of course.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.000
The owner is overreacting.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.950
So what if a VVIP is coming?
Does she have to freak out?

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:06.180
You know how greedy she is.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.900
Don't you know?

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.590
She was a protege of Michelle,
the best in the field.

01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:13.200
But she betrayed her and opened this place.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.280
She stole all of her regulars, too.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.230
I heard about that.

01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:20.960
Who's the VVIP who's coming today, anyway?

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.330
I don't know the details.

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:26.510
Daeyang Group's chairwoman?
And her only daughter, apparently.

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:29.640
So envious.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.270
Ready, go.

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:33.830
Welcome to Jullee Beauty Salon.

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:36.290
Bend your backs more. Go again.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:39.170
Welcome to Jullee Beauty Salon.

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:43.250
You're wondering why I'm making
a fuss first thing in the morning.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.820
How should I say?

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:49.040
There's a clear difference
between a VIP and a VVIP.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.300
What's the difference?

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.480
Clear difference.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.210
It's their influence.

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.930
Rather than having 10 VIPs,

01:11:56.930 --> 01:12:04.810
I'm saying having one VVIP here
has a bigger impact.

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:07.430
So, what are we supposed to do today?

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:09.390
We need to do a good job.

01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:13.560
You need to hold onto that VVIP.
That's what I'm saying.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.670
Do you understand?

01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:16.330
Yes.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.730
I'll be in charge of the chairwoman myself.

01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:23.260
- Manager Jo.
- Yes.

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:26.030
Be in charge of her daughter.

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:28.650
You know the younger ones are more picky, right?

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:32.470
Dry and comb thoroughly and smoothly. Okay?

01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:34.170
Okay. Got it.

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:35.200
They're here.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.750
Okay. Let's get ready.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.030
Gosh. Chairwoman, you came.

01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.470
Welcome.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:01.060
Come this way.

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:04.340
Chairwoman, please watch the steps.

01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:10.010
Welcome to Jullee Beauty Salon.

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:23.630
Hello. I'm a staff designer, Ko Yeong Rye.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:25.640
I'm in your care.

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.060
- Oh, my gosh!
- Can't you be careful?

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.440
She has a fear of sharp objects.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.940
Daeyang Group's only daughter
is the Seo Jong Hui we know?

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.160
I thought I was mistaken at first, too.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.530
Jong Hui...

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:37.760
Yeong Rye.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.570
Jae Pil, to be honest, recently...

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:43.860
The lady asked me to bring you.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.840
Hello. Nice to meet you.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.730
I'll forget. But please forget my past, too.
