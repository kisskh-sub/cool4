00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.080
forcing each of them to learn how to kill.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.480
You have no parents,

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.960
no family, and no ties.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.670
Your life

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.220
is worth less than an ant's.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.900
From time to time,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.980
they'd send in condemned prisoners.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.010
Only the victors

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.630
got to survive.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.550
I guess

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.480
it must be because you
rescued me

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.840
from the death camp

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.080
that
I only trusted you

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.720
back then.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.350
That's right.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.200
Then you served in my army

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.480
and made the military camp your home.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.790
You considered Ning Fei and Weiran

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.720
as your family.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.760
So that's how it was.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.240
All those years, you and I

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.390
fought on the battlefield
and risked our lives.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.590
I don't know how many times you saved me.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.800
Do you still remember

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.000
when you insisted on

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.870
wearing
a red battle robe
on the battlefield?

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.080
That's why you were called

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.480
the Red-Clad General.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.870
I guess it was because on the battlefield,

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.000
one was bound to get wounded and bleed,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.600
and wearing a red robe
meant

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.720
even if I bled,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.440
the enemy wouldn't notice,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.790
it wouldn't hurt morale,

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.190
and I wouldn't look weak.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.870
No.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.550
You did it for me.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.210
You insisted on wearing red

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.280
to stand out on the battlefield.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.500
You wanted

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.020
to draw the enemy's attention

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.420
and take the blows for me.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.560
Unfortunately,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.130
I don't remember anything.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.880
It's alright.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.130
There's no rush.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.850
We have plenty of time.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.390
I'll help you remember everything—

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.120
everything

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.580
we went through together.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.960
Trust me,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.790
will you?

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.030
Okay.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.080
Xia Jingshi,

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.450
so it was you who tried to kill me.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.120
But why do you want me dead?

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.840
Your Highness.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.150
Fu Yixiao

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200
is so ungrateful.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.320
Your Highness,

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.510
don't stoop to her level.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.360
There's no need to get upset

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.200
with a woman
who can't tell right from wrong.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.960
She doesn't remember anything,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.240
but the moment she saw her old master,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.980
she was desperate

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.240
to return to him

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.770
and serve in his army again.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.600
She seemed smart enough before,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.570
but at the critical moment,

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.750
she's clueless,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.390
not even knowing

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.240
the one who wants her dead

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.150
is Xia Jingshi.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.240
No.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.790
She already knows.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.800
Lu Ke.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:11.780
No need.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.640
Help me.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.850
I'll go to find Xueying myself.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.860
Wait…

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.270
What about that letter?

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.140
Well,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.840
it's been successfully
delivered to Jinxiu.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.360
By now,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.560
the Emperor of Jinxiu must have read it.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.660
[Yifeng Hall]

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.390
So,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.630
the Prince of Zhennan and Xiyang

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.310
shot arrows together.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.570
They truly seem like a loving couple.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.440
Did a lot of people

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.840
see that?

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.720
Quite a few people saw it.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.050
I personally heard

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.390
many of the commoners present

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.480
praising the two of them,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.480
saying they look perfect together.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.350
The people of Susha

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.720
have prejudices
against the Prince of Zhennan

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.580
that won't disappear overnight.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.550
Luckily,
because of this marriage alliance,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.080
His Majesty granted a general amnesty,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.580
which eased

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.720
some of the resentment against him.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.100
It's just a pity

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.170
that Fu Yixiao

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.250
got into the Prince of Zhennan's carriage
in the end

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.790
and headed back with him.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.740
The Prince of Zhennan actually left

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.910
Princess Xiyang alone.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.050
I'm afraid those with ill intentions

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.360
who noticed this

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.720
will spread rumors.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.430
I'd like to see

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.140
which fool out there

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.480
dares to spread rumors and start trouble.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.050
All right, go back.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.790
Don't come here for the next few days

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.920
unless I summon you,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.390
lest the Princess become suspicious.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:39.920
Yes,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.090
I'll take my leave.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.870
I heard a rumor from the court today

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.790
about Fu Yixiao.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.440
Your Majesty,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.820
that's true.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.930
The Prince of Zhennan,
under the pretext of exchanging prisoners,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.080
has requested to take Fu Yixiao

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.960
back to Jinxiu.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.240
Summon Xun Xiang to see me.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.480
Yes.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.370
Your Highness.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.720
Yixiao.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.080
I heard you're ill,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.410
so I came to check on you.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.000
Weiran is still

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.960
handling some official matters

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.220
and will be here later.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.520
Miss Ling,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.600
how is she?

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.870
Not good.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.420
Is there anything wrong

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.660
with Yixiao's pulse?

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.240
Yixiao is fine.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.750
I'll just give her something
to calm her nerves.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.720
I mean,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.790
Prince of Zhennan,

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.670
you're not looking good.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.590
His Highness?

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.480
Stop pretending to be fine.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.440
If you keep holding the blood in,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.390
when the toxins hit your heart,

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.510
even the gods won't be able to save you.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.440
What do you mean?

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.300
Your Highness!

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.750
Your Highness.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.360
Your Highness!

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.710
Your poison is flaring up again.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.860
Your Highness,

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.820
hang in there.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.200
Reinforcements will arrive soon.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.890
Hang in there.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.650
Yixiao,

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.120
go on without me.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.690
No.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.550
I'm not leaving.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.390
Listen to me,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.700
after I die,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.720
the Emperor certainly won't

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.730
spare any of you.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.260
Take this.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.150
With it,
you can command
the Zhennan Army.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.010
Get out of here.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.680
Now.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200
I don't want this!

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.510
I'm not leaving you behind.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.510
Don't worry about me.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.260
Just go.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.470
Go!

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.840
I'll live or die with you, Your Highness!

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.120
It's a military order!

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.840
Stay alive.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.760
His poison has flared up.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.020
What kind of poison

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.400
is he suffering from?

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.349
There's no cure
for that poison.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.109
Each month when the poison strikes,
he suffers greatly.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.310
He must take the antidote immediately.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.420
And the antidote?

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.790
Where is it?

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.030
The wedding procession

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.400
will soon arrive in Yujing.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.600
The antidote will be delivered with it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.730
Don't worry.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.000
I'm fine.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:34.960
Xueying,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.470
can you make an antidote?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.270
I can only prepare medicine

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.200
to ease his pain

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.040
and make him feel better.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.230
Thank you, Miss Ling.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.690
Don't just stand there.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.420
Come with me.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.350
Give me a hand.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.880
Okay.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.920
Do you really have a way

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.520
to ease His Highness's pain?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.770
Of course.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.330
I tasted hundreds of herbs
when I was 5,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.480
learned diagnostics at 10,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.400
and by 13, I had mastered

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.880
all of my father's medical skills.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.410
My treatments always work.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.830
How dare you doubt me?

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:19.560
I just do.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.680
I...

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.080
Are you really that good?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.590
Of course.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.330
I run the entire Zhengnian Villa
on my own.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.440
I can't do that with just empty talk.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.280
That's true.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.030
If the First Prince of Susha trusts you

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.240
to treat Yixiao,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.160
you must have some skill.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.160
Yixiao.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.550
Don't worry.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.200
I'll be fine.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.480
If you have any questions,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.410
go ahead and ask.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.120
How did you get poisoned?

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.170
It's so severe.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.390
You're still the same,

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.500
just like before.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.000
When you have doubts,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.130
you'll stop at nothing to get answers.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.330
You can't keep anything to yourself.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.960
The poison in me
is a secret.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.880
I remember

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.440
the first time you saw me

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.560
suffering from the poison.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.110
You kept asking me why.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.680
I wouldn't tell you,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.000
but you just wouldn't give up

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:41.960
and kept asking.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.880
So,

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.840
you're still not planning to tell me?

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.960
Not now.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.270
One day I will tell you.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.410
Is that

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.100
what you told me back then too?

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.440
Yes.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.880
The truth behind my poisoning—

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.310
you,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.790
Ning Fei, and Weiran—

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.190
none of you know about it.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.630
Have you remembered something?

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.830
Bits and pieces.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.030
I remember one time
your poison flared up.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.540
You thought you were going to die

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.880
and told me to leave you behind

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.140
and escape for my life.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.160
That was the battle

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.620
at Shahekou two years ago.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.550
We were in a hopeless situation.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.720
I ordered you to leave me behind.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.310
That was the first time

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.640
you disobeyed my order,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.000
staying by my side no matter what

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.030
until the reinforcements arrived.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.170
I never thought

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.920
we'd been through so many brushes

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.120
with death together.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.400
Yixiao.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.130
Don't worry.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.160
I'll help you remember

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.760
everything you want to know.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.150
Ask me anything you want to know.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.070
I'll tell you.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.960
From now on, with me by your side,

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.730
you won't get hurt again.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.920
Trust me,

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.270
will you?

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.160
Of course I trust you.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.170
There's a scar on my left leg.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.260
I didn't even remember how I got it

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.480
until Ning Fei

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.270
told me.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.040
It turns out

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.420
I was once ambushed and captured.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.790
If you hadn't risked your life to save me,

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.680
my leg would have been crippled.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.070
I don't remember any of that myself.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.310
That's not right.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.590
What Yixiao heard was

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.510
that she was captured

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.200
while trying to save His Highness.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.160
Why is she turning it around

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.550
to say His Highness risked his life
to save her?

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.080
Is she testing His Highness

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.120
or trying to gain his trust?

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.170
You're still very weak.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.240
Talking less will help you recover.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.190
Rest well.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.750
I'll stay here

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.050
with Xueying for now

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.640
until you've recovered.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.200
Sir.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.030
I'm here.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.200
You're an hour late.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.770
There were soldiers on duty near the inn.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.640
On my way here,

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.880
I had to be extra careful

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.080
not to expose myself,

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.550
so it took longer.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.200
The inn where you're staying

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.270
is guarded
by the Imperial Guards' Bing Division.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.720
I scheduled our meeting

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.790
for the time

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.310
when the Bing Division changes shifts.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.160
Shouldn't it be easy

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.430
to escape their notice

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.440
at that time?

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.440
I also had to watch out

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.690
for Feng Suige's spies
lurking in the dark.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.310
Feng Suige hasn't placed any men there.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.880
How do you know that?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.110
Nothing that happens in Yujing City

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.510
escapes me.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.030
Since your master

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.160
arrived in Yujing,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.350
he's met with the Emperor, the Empress,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.610
and even the Princess.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.400
Right now, he's probably
so busy arranging his marriage

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.240
that he's forgotten everything

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.930
I told you to do.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.830
Rest assured.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.580
We'll never go back

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.990
on our word.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.260
Why is Fu Yixiao still alive?

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.440
You can't even take down one woman.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.290
If you're so incompetent,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.490
I'll have to do it myself.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.290
And I'll have to reconsider

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.200
whether you're still

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.640
worth cooperating with.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.500
With Feng Suige around,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.960
killing her isn't so easy.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.990
I need the right opportunity.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.930
Such cowardice.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.660
How can you get anything done?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.070
I know you'll meet

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.000
Fu Yixiao again.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.060
That's your chance.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.670
But if I act rashly,

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.490
Feng Suige may learn of

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.070
His Highness's plans too soon.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.190
Cut the crap!

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.940
I want Fu Yixiao dead.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.070
Stop hesitating

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.330
and being indecisive.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.920
Just follow my orders.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.830
Sir, don't forget

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.590
this is only a partnership.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.210
I don't take orders from you.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.920
Don't you forget

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.400
where you are now.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.830
Offend me,

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.640
and the consequences will be far worse

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.170
than offending Feng Suige.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.130
Please give me more time.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.030
I don't want to hear your excuses.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.740
I only care about the results.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.640
I know every move

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.290
each of you makes.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.930
This time,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.490
don't disappoint me again.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.790
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.410
Yixiao,

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.240
don't worry.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.110
I'll help you remember

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.710
everything you want to know.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.340
Don't forget,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.890
you're still my concubine now.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.040
Don't push your luck.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.810
I want Xia Jingshi to see

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.330
that his beloved general

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.390
is now mine.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.480
Sister.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.360
Sister,

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.190
what's wrong?

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.420
I remembered something.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.600
Tell me.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.990
What did you remember?

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.080
The one who shot me off the cliff

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:03.750
was Xia Jingshi.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.360
What did you say?

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.870
Are you sure it was him?

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.830
I've wondered

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.380
if my memories are confused,

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.840
if I was imagining things.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.550
But I went over every conversation

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.750
I've had with Xia Jingshi

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.790
since we met.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.550
He always seemed

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.590
to be subtly testing

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.320
what exactly I had remembered.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.070
Have you remembered something?

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.260
Ning Fei and Xiao Weiran told me

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.270
that the moment

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.870
they heard I was still alive,

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.290
they rushed to Yujing.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.080
Don't you find that strange?

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.080
Isn't it because he was worried about you?

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.190
I hope I'm overthinking this,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.680
but I feel

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.170
it's more than just worry.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.480
I did think

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.110
it was someone close to you.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.350
I suspected Ning Fei.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.640
I suspected Xiao Weiran.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.290
But never have I

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.620
suspected Xia Jingshi.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.100
I always thought

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.660
he was a good man.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.940
If I hadn't remembered

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.440
the moment before I fell off the cliff,

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.170
I'd also think he was a good man.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.510
In some of the memories I've recovered,

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.160
we fought side by side

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.840
and looked out for each other.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.480
He showed me

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.590
a lot of kindness.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.750
But why did he do that?

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.550
I don't know.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.480
I don't know

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.740
why he did that either.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.480
That's why

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.480
I need to stay by Xia Jingshi's side.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.420
Ever since I met him,

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.190
he's been guarded around me.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.720
Only when he completely
lets his guard down

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.440
will I get the truth.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.340
Your Highness.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.510
It's me, Weiran.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.200
Come in.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.020
Your Highness.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.020
I went to the inn

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.160
and retrieved this.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.400
Have you forgotten

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.440
what I told you?

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.680
Of course not.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.010
I just can't bear to see you

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.460
suffer from the poison.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.630
You've saved up

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.430
these antidotes over the years.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.340
Please,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.500
take one this time.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.900
Before my grand plan begins,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.030
these antidotes must not be touched.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:13.690
I don't want

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.350
to repeat myself again.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:18.440
Understood.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:19.560
By the way,

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.160
any changes

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.240
with the prisoner exchange
to rescue Yixiao?

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:23.830
No.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.410
Susha has agreed to release Yixiao

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.970
and let her return with us.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:32.590
What's wrong?

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.060
Your Highness,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.590
don't you think

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.890
something's off about Yixiao?

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.570
When I met her that day,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.550
she had no interest in catching up.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.640
All she cared about
was recovering her memories.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.960
I don't think she even remembers

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.070
the bond we once shared.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.240
She only wanted

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.870
to extract the truth from me.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.510
Don't you feel the same, Your Highness?

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.070
Were you

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.270
eavesdropping on us?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.680
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.460
Put yourself in her shoes.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.720
If I were Yixiao,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440
seeing my former

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.440
friends and comrades now,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440
I'd also want to ask

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.170
what happened to me in the past.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.070
I believe Yixiao knows deep down

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.740
that she's still one of us.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.310
Besides, she's now in enemy territory,

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.720
constantly on guard
against
her mortal enemy,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.400
Feng Suige.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.960
She definitely sees us

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960
as her own people.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.750
But...

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.620
Enough.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.050
I've said all I need to say.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.640
I finally got some trust

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.790
with Yixiao.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.030
I don't want

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.350
this hard-won trust

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.170
to be ruined.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.960
Weiran.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.310
Your caution and persistence

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.020
are your strengths.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.480
But you don't need
to suspect everything.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.430
Even the wisest can make mistakes.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.720
I don't think there is

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.250
anything off about Yixiao.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.150
You're overthinking it.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.370
Yes, Your Highness.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.750
I'm just worried

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.090
she might remember

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.500
the truth about that day on the cliff.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.430
After all…

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.300
Your Highness!

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.750
I also hope

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.610
she never remembers that moment.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.700
Come.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.440
No matter what happened in the past,

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.480
I don't want Yixiao

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.410
to suffer even the slightest harm.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.890
Understood.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.410
Your Highness,

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.400
rest early.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.130
I'll take my leave.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.160
Rise.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.200
Get rid of someone for me
as soon as possible.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.250
Who is it?

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.120
A girl from the Jinxiu Kingdom.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.470
Her name is Fu Yixiao.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.100
The female prisoner

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.480
brought back by the First Prince?

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.240
What?

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.910
Having second thoughts?

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.750
You don't dare to harm Feng Suige's woman?

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.650
The Xun family

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.480
may be only distant relatives
of Your Majesty,

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.530
but for years,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.400
we've benefited from your grace.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.570
To serve you

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.070
is my honor

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.130
and my family's blessing.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.270
You have no choice but to succeed.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.570
And no one shall ever know about it.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.720
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.020
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.880
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.920
You're finally here.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.250
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.570
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.110
We're in the heart of the capital.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.460
You're the dignified Minister of Rites.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.960
Stop shouting. Show some decorum.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.640
The First Prince

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.350
proposed

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.790
a shocking plan.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.160
He said that after the marriage alliance
is formed,

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.760
he wants the Prince of Zhennan
to stay in Susha.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.370
Explain.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.180
He wants the Prince of Zhennan
to marry into Susha

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.510
and be the Emperor's live-in son-in-law!

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:29.630
Your Majesty.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.660
Shen Wu has already spoken to you?

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:33.030
Yes.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.350
I assume you're aware of the situation.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.260
Then tell me,

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.750
what do you think?

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.460
In my humble opinion,

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.620
forcing the Prince of Zhennan

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.190
to stay in Susha

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.480
is unwise.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.150
Jinxiu proposed the marriage alliance,

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.580
and we agreed.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.090
But neither side ever said

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.960
that it had to be
Jinxiu's Prince of Zhennan

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.750
who takes our princess away.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.300
That means

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.280
we can propose instead

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.240
that the Prince of Zhennan

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.370
stay in Susha as a live-in son-in-law.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.790
Prime Minister Zhuang,

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.199
what's wrong with that?

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.030
It's a marriage alliance
between two nations.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.800
Even among the common folk,

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.960
it's always the bride
who moves in with the groom.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.139
That's long been the custom.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.530
Who set that custom?

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.790
Your Highness,

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.440
this concerns two nations.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.280
Please think of the bigger picture.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.989
Marriage is not war.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.449
It isn't about victory or defeat.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.630
Exactly.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.429
It's precisely for the bigger picture

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.170
that I want Xia Jingshi to stay in Susha.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.110
This way, we won't break
the marriage alliance

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.690
or ruin the peace between the two nations.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.290
We gain nothing but benefit.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:40.960
We can't do that.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.100
Why not?

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.810
The war has only just stopped.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.440
If you kept Xia Jingshi in Susha,

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.000
wouldn't that reignite the flames of war?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.480
Without Xia Jingshi, the Zhennan Army

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.650
will be leaderless.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.190
I don't believe the Emperor of Jinxiu

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.280
would dare declare war on us.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.409
And even if he dares,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.300
why should we be afraid?

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.260
Even in war, we don't kill the envoys.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.290
Yet now, under the guise

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.190
of a marriage alliance,
you want to detain their prince.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.000
Wouldn't that be going back on our word

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.010
and make everyone

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.110
despise us?

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.840
How is it going back on our word?

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.000
When the Emperor of Jinxiu
proposed the alliance,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.070
did he ever say

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.880
we couldn't have the Prince of Zhennan

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.480
marry into Susha?

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.160
But it's against custom.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.310
Which custom exactly?

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.070
Does Susha have any law forbidding

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.150
a man from being a live-in son-in-law?

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.030
Are you objecting

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.290
in Susha's interests,

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.030
or are you actually

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.920
on Jinxiu's side?

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.800
You…

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.800
Enough!

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.320
Your Majesty, please judge wisely.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.710
I believe the First Prince

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.710
proposed this reckless plan
out of personal resentment.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.880
Because Xia Jingshi

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.550
demanded to take away

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.230
the female general called Fu Yixiao,

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.400
the First Prince is deliberately

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.260
making things difficult for him.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.840
Fu Yixiao is your prisoner.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.880
Xia Jingshi wants a prisoner exchange.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880
What do you think?

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.800
Fine.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.510
As long as Your Majesty decrees

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.360
that Xia Jingshi be held in Susha,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.480
that woman

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.940
can be returned to Jinxiu.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.930
Your Majesty, you must not!

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.080
I want Xia Jingshi detained,

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.470
yet you keep obstructing me.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.890
Could it be
that keeping Xia Jingshi here

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.720
would ruin some scheme of yours,
Prime Minister Zhuang?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.260
What nonsense is that?

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.190
As the Prime Minister,

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.070
you oppose

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.550
a plan that clearly benefits Susha

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.880
at every turn.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:32.970
Instead of focusing on state policy,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.440
you worry whether marrying into Susha

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.320
might damage

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.790
Xia Jingshi's pride.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.000
You might as well resign
from your position

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.030
and go serve

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:42.070
as Xia Jingshi's strategist instead.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.320
Your Highness targets me at every turn.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.000
Is it because of that matter

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.970
from years ago?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.150
I have said before—

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.960
what happened back then

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.280
is not

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.230
to be mentioned again.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.830
Your Majesty,

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.380
I spoke out of turn
in the heat of the moment.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.920
Please forgive me.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.040
This is a serious matter

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.550
that requires careful consideration.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.400
We need to discuss it
with the Emperor of Jinxiu.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.030
Your Majesty,

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.920
I've already sent a letter

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.430
to the Emperor of Jinxiu,

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.570
formally raising the matter

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.320
of Xia Jingshi marrying into Susha.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.430
Soon enough,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.280
we will have

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.730
his reply.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.480
Your Majesty…

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.810
Prime Minister Zhuang,

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.360
you may leave.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.440
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.980
[Yujing City]

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.960
The wedding procession
of the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.560
is about to arrive in Yujing!

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.280
[Peace]

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.320
The wedding procession
of the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.920
is about to arrive in Yujing!

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.360
When did you write to Xia Jingyan?

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.680
Three days ago.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.130
By calculation,

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.000
he should have read

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.260
the letter last night.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.310
Here is the exact message I sent,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.850
word for word.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.840
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.480
Read it.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.150
"The Prince of Zhennan is
both wise and brave,

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.440
a talent sent by Heaven.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.510
In him, I see brilliance

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.800
beyond compare—

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.080
even Song Yu cannot surpass him,

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.210
nor can Zhou Gongjin rival him.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.640
My father once said

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.260
gaining such a son-in-law

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.400
is better than gaining 100,000 scholars.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.750
He cherishes him

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.380
as his own flesh and blood.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.000
As for my sister Xiyang,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
apple of Father's eye,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.290
she once attended Father on his sickbed.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.800
Her filial piety and virtue
are rare in this age.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.550
Father cannot bear
to marry her off to a distant land,

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.030
and he treasures the brilliance
of the Prince of Zhennan too.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.350
In Yujing,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.150
we'll present grand estates
and fertile lands as gifts,

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:04.070
hoping the Prince of Zhennan
may remain in Susha—

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.000
father and daughter together,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.330
brothers close, husband and wife united.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.440
Your wish to strengthen bonds
between our two nations
can be fulfilled.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.440
Everyone in Susha

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.240
admires the Prince of Zhennan.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.750
We earnestly request you
to consider it

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.730
and graciously give your assent."

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.840
Not easy.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.320
Not easy at all.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.400
Writing such high praise
for the Prince of Zhennan—

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.890
you really know how to bend when needed.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:28.670
Among all the civil officials in my court,

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:29.510
I can hardly

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.840
find anyone who can flatter

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.440
Xia Jingshi better than you.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.820
Thank you for your praise.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.390
How dare you!

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.400
Your Majesty, you should wait

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.860
until the Emperor
of Jinxiu's reply arrives

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.360
and then see whether my move

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.750
was bold

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.320
and reckless.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.380
You sure can keep your cool.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.660
It seems

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.630
you already know how Xia Jingyan

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.760
will handle this.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.180
He will agree.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.480
Actually, Xia Jingyan

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.110
may even fan the flames

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:01.460
to push Xia Jingshi
into marrying into Susha.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.510
After all, whether for us

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.350
or for the Emperor of Jinxiu,

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.190
keeping the Prince of Zhennan,

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.630
who's backed by an army, in Susha

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.680
brings only benefits and no harm.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.760
I bet Xia Jingyan

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.090
would have been pleased

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.840
when he read this letter.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.230
The letter has been sent,

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.550
so there's no taking it back.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.710
Xia Jingshi

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.030
wouldn't like

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.710
what the letter will bring forth,

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.140
but Susha

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.840
will benefit a lot from it.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.470
Yet still, you acted on your own,

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.480
interfering with the major affairs
between the two nations.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.010
Your Majesty once taught me

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.440
that the wise weigh gains and losses.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.190
That letter was written

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.400
after I thought it through carefully

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.630
and analyzed the pros and cons.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.630
Enough.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.070
Don't fob me off

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.230
with those high-sounding words.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.960
I'm not Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.680
I don't have the patience
to argue with you.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.000
I did act on my own.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:55.490
For the nation,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.630
I want to understand
why Jinxiu is so eager

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.800
to form a marriage alliance with Susha.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.460
For myself,

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:01.900
I want to see

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.230
how Xia Jingshi will treat Xiyang

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.350
after marrying her.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.150
I don't expect

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.470
to keep him long.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.150
A year or two
is enough

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.800
to see everything clearly.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.320
If this letter

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:17.360
damages

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.030
the peace between our two nations,

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.800
I will accept the blame.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.400
All right.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.630
You may leave.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.630
Your Majesty, you look so pleased.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:50.290
Has something good happened?

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.180
He didn't disappoint me.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.710
Your Majesty, you mean

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.920
the First Prince?

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.430
[Emperor, the Prince of Zhennan is both
wise and brave, a talent sent by Heaven.]

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:05.650
[In him, I see brilliance beyond compare—
even Song Yu cannot surpass him,]

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:06.390
[nor can Zhou Gongjin rival him.
My father once said]

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.110
[gaining such a son-in-law
is better than gaining 100,000 scholars.]

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:08.030
[He cherishes him
as his own flesh and blood.]

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:08.240
[Shengfu Hall]

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:15.990
[Shengfu Hall,
the Imperial Palace of Jinxiu]

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.280
[Shengfu Hall]

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.940
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.160
[Empress Dowager Jing of Jinxiu]

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:38.300
You…

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.480
Clear everyone out.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:45.840
All of them?

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.910
Such disgraceful behavior

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.510
must never be known outside these walls.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:50.320
[Shengfu Hall]

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:50.960
Yes.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:02.980
Empress Dowager, please wait.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.960
His Majesty is occupied at the moment.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.760
His Majesty is in rare good spirits today.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.540
Leave.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.000
Hurry!

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.920
Your Majesty!

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.840
[Xia Jingyan, Emperor of Jinxiu]
