Yao.

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.013
Take a break.

00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:53.132
Let's talk about

00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:55.212
the makeup and the clothing

00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:56.173
for the next episode.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:01:59.653
What's wrong?

00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:01.492
Why are you down?

00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:05.412
We've been spending on fabrics

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:06.733
and filming equipment

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:08.132
like water flowing.

00:02:08.892 --> 00:02:09.973
Our startup funds

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:12.253
are almost gone.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.692
I just feel that you trusted me so much,

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:17.012
but the videos we posted

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:18.813
got zero response.

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:22.213
I feel terribly guilty.

00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:26.132
Snap out of it.

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:27.653
Stop overthinking.

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.132
You're our stylist.

00:02:29.172 --> 00:02:31.412
Just focus on making good outfits.

00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:32.933
Don't worry about anything else.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.012
We'll handle them.

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:34.653
Got it?

00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:38.053
Then I'll keep trying.

00:02:38.773 --> 00:02:40.253
Not a single stitch will be wasted.

00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:42.412
You were saying?

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:43.973
Here's the thing.

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:45.412
Take a look.

00:02:45.852 --> 00:02:47.053
Pick from these.

00:02:47.412 --> 00:02:49.093
I also brought many lipsticks

00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:51.053
for you to pick.

00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:54.132
We'll only expand our consumer base

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.452
after building brand awareness.

00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:58.213
Many college students

00:02:58.213 --> 00:02:59.612
and young customers

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.933
are fond of ethnic-style accessories.

00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:02.933
Let's take a look

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.292
at our overall design philosophy.

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.093
As you can see,

00:03:07.093 --> 00:03:08.892
we want ethnic clothing

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:10.172
to shine globally

00:03:10.172 --> 00:03:11.132
and make an impact.

00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:13.933
We've also conducted some research.

00:03:14.053 --> 00:03:16.012
Young girl around 20

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:17.892
now prefer ethnic outfits,

00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:19.412
including Chinese-style clothing.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:21.172
Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.653
We've prepared a presentation.

00:03:23.973 --> 00:03:26.012
We target ethnic-style apparel

00:03:26.053 --> 00:03:27.292
with customized designs.

00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:28.933
This is to you. Cheers.

00:03:30.572 --> 00:03:31.292
Office workers.

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:32.933
This design...

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:35.373
It has modern styling...

00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:40.612
It's highly adaptable.

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:44.493
It makes a fashionable daily wear.

00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:14.933
Hello?

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:15.933
Mr. Ding?

00:04:17.893 --> 00:04:18.732
This is Xu Yan.

00:04:18.773 --> 00:04:19.292
Yeah.

00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:20.693
Nothing urgent.

00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:21.812
I just wanted to

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:24.372

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:27.093
Please review it

when you have time. Thank you.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:30.252

Shen Haoming.

00:05:58.852 --> 00:05:59.653
Why are you here?

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:05.492
I came to check on Yan.

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:07.333
Save it.

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:12.252
I feel like
speaking for my sister today.

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:15.093
She did make mistakes,

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:17.013
but you're not so innocent, either.

00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:19.052
She tried so hard

00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:21.252
to save your relationship.

00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:22.492
But what did you do?

00:06:23.013 --> 00:06:24.693
Now she's running around,

00:06:24.693 --> 00:06:25.693
securing investments.

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:27.773
If you'd treated her better,

00:06:27.773 --> 00:06:29.812
she wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:31.252
Now you're being nice?

00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:32.333
That's unnecessary.

00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:37.693
I want to help her,
but she keeps refusing.

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:39.492
Please talk to her.

00:06:39.852 --> 00:06:41.372
No, I won't.

00:06:43.492 --> 00:06:44.812
She won't take

00:06:44.812 --> 00:06:45.932
another penny from you.

00:06:46.893 --> 00:06:47.973
You should just leave.

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:49.492
And don't come back.

00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:03.412
Ms. Xu,

00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:05.533
the popularity and views of your videos

00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:07.932
haven't met our expectations.

00:07:08.172 --> 00:07:10.533
We will sit on your proposal for now.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.573
Alright, thank you, Mr. Zhang.
Looking forward to working with you.

00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:14.052
Alright.

00:07:14.492 --> 00:07:15.773
Same here.

00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:30.492
Ms. Xu.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.213
Mr. Jiang Liang.

00:07:36.252 --> 00:07:37.093
Call me Mr. Liang.

00:07:38.252 --> 00:07:38.773
Mr. Liang.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.336
What a coincidence.

00:07:41.052 --> 00:07:42.492
I have meetings scheduled here

00:07:42.693 --> 00:07:44.013
for some venture projects.

00:07:44.852 --> 00:07:46.172
Are you here

00:07:46.893 --> 00:07:48.292
for some promising ventures?

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:50.453
Share the information

00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:51.252
if you don't mind.

00:07:51.984 --> 00:07:53.872
(Yan Studio)

00:07:54.013 --> 00:07:55.492
I'm seeking funding.

00:07:55.932 --> 00:07:56.693
Seeking funding?

00:07:58.172 --> 00:07:58.693
You?

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:02.612
Yes, me.

00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:05.052
Ms. Xu, you must be joking.

00:08:05.932 --> 00:08:06.932
I'm dead serious.

00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:08.412
Really.

00:08:09.492 --> 00:08:11.052
So the rumors are true.

00:08:11.812 --> 00:08:13.773
You and Shen Haoming fell out.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.013
That's irrelevant.

00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:25.773
What's your project about?

00:08:38.492 --> 00:08:39.813
Fashion-related short videos.

00:08:40.732 --> 00:08:41.852
We aim to expand into

00:08:41.852 --> 00:08:43.012
offline garment production.

00:08:43.612 --> 00:08:44.252
Short videos?

00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:48.492
Why enter such saturated waters?

00:08:50.372 --> 00:08:51.093
Mr. Jiang Liang...

00:08:51.612 --> 00:08:52.053
Sorry.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.213
Mr. Liang.

00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:55.132
Any thoughts?

00:08:56.933 --> 00:08:59.053
Statistically speaking, I'm pessimistic.

00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:01.053
By Q2 this year,

00:09:01.413 --> 00:09:02.372
there are 1.55 billion

00:09:02.573 --> 00:09:03.492
short video accounts

00:09:03.492 --> 00:09:05.213
across major platforms.

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:07.652
There are 15.08 million

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:08.973
professional streamers,

00:09:09.252 --> 00:09:11.732
500,000 accounts with 100K fans,

00:09:12.132 --> 00:09:13.852
40,000 with a million fans,

00:09:14.093 --> 00:09:16.693
and just 1,000
with 10 million followers.

00:09:17.892 --> 00:09:19.612
You want to stand out

00:09:19.612 --> 00:09:21.892
in 80 million daily uploads?

00:09:21.892 --> 00:09:22.933
All I can say is

00:09:24.973 --> 00:09:25.732
good luck.

00:09:27.892 --> 00:09:29.093
Impressive, Mr. Liang.

00:09:30.372 --> 00:09:32.053
You're very well-informed.

00:09:36.652 --> 00:09:38.732
Now, your design is not bad.

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:42.333
It fuses ethnic and avant-garde styles.

00:09:43.453 --> 00:09:44.012
But

00:09:45.892 --> 00:09:46.732
it lacks uniqueness.

00:09:47.532 --> 00:09:49.132
The execution is superficial.

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:50.213
It lacks soul.

00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:51.612
My rule is

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:54.173
better risky than boring.

00:09:57.492 --> 00:09:58.213
No offense.

00:09:59.173 --> 00:10:00.132
That's just me.

00:10:00.772 --> 00:10:01.532
Straight talker.

00:10:01.612 --> 00:10:02.333
No offense taken.

00:10:03.573 --> 00:10:05.012
Your comment is constructive.

00:10:06.252 --> 00:10:07.213
I agree.

00:10:08.053 --> 00:10:09.492
To get investors,

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:11.693
work on three essentials:

00:10:12.532 --> 00:10:13.372
thorough research,

00:10:14.173 --> 00:10:15.053
clear strengths,

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:16.492
and absolute execution.

00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:18.693
But most people

00:10:18.892 --> 00:10:20.693
obsess over the idea alone.

00:10:21.532 --> 00:10:22.852
Their approach is wrong.

00:10:23.612 --> 00:10:26.252
If we don't emphasize
project-specific context,

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:27.333
what should we address?

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:30.492
The investors.

00:10:32.892 --> 00:10:34.053
The investors?

00:10:35.492 --> 00:10:36.772
Every investment firm

00:10:36.772 --> 00:10:38.213
has its own philosophy

00:10:38.293 --> 00:10:39.372
and key focus areas.

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:43.813
Some value accurate
market understanding,

00:10:44.413 --> 00:10:46.492
others emphasize unique selling points,

00:10:46.573 --> 00:10:48.693
while some focus on your execution.

00:10:49.252 --> 00:10:51.162
Therefore, you must tailor
your proposals

00:10:51.162 --> 00:10:53.333
according to the priorities

00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:55.093
of each investment firm.

00:10:55.892 --> 00:10:59.213
That ensures higher success rates.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:13.612
Thank you.

00:11:15.652 --> 00:11:16.933
Don't be discouraged, though.

00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:19.012
It's a solid project.

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:20.612
Make proper adjustments.

00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:22.852
It will work.

00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:27.612
Mr. Liang,

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:31.173
from an investor's perspective,

00:11:32.973 --> 00:11:34.213
would you fund this project?

00:11:36.012 --> 00:11:37.492
In its current state,

00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:43.772
I wouldn't.

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:46.693
But I can bring you

00:11:46.693 --> 00:11:47.813
a great photographer

00:11:47.813 --> 00:11:48.933
who's my friend.

00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:51.492
My connection comes free.

00:11:53.492 --> 00:11:54.053
Thank you.

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:55.973
No problem. It's nothing.

00:11:58.492 --> 00:11:59.173
Let me add you

00:12:00.772 --> 00:12:01.492
on WeChat.

00:12:02.173 --> 00:12:02.732
Alright.

00:12:04.813 --> 00:12:05.648
I'll scan your code.

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:07.053
Done.

00:12:11.132 --> 00:12:11.933
Mr. Shen,

00:12:12.612 --> 00:12:14.933
many executives couldn't believe that

00:12:15.492 --> 00:12:17.213
the Cheng'an County project
made a comeback.

00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:19.492
Hongyun is notorious.

00:12:19.892 --> 00:12:22.053
Nobody wants to deal with it.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:23.252
But this time,

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:26.053
you solved the problems impressively.

00:12:26.573 --> 00:12:28.933
This project has been revitalized.

00:12:29.213 --> 00:12:30.132
So what?

00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:32.732
I'm still sidelined.

00:12:32.973 --> 00:12:34.933
Don't you already have a plan?

00:12:35.933 --> 00:12:38.213
The Baraikins will arrive in Jingzhou

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:39.772
for vacation at Yanbo Resort.

00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:42.093
Golden paint.

00:12:48.173 --> 00:12:49.612
Jinda's overseas expansion

00:12:50.372 --> 00:12:51.813
has long sought cooperation with

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.252
this Russian real estate tycoon.

00:12:53.892 --> 00:12:55.093
It's a great opportunity.

00:12:55.252 --> 00:12:56.132
But someone

00:12:56.772 --> 00:12:58.173
might've beaten us to it.

00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:00.933
Situo Construction?

00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:05.492
They assigned someone named Steve to
speak to the Baraikins.

00:13:06.732 --> 00:13:08.492
Let him be the vanguard.

00:13:10.492 --> 00:13:11.173
Done.

00:13:12.252 --> 00:13:12.852
Chen Lin.

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:14.252
I composed this

00:13:14.492 --> 00:13:17.973
from 2,441 pieces of agave leaves.

00:13:18.093 --> 00:13:18.732
Impressive?

00:13:27.053 --> 00:13:27.652
Cool.

00:13:48.132 --> 00:13:48.892
Thank you.

00:13:51.012 --> 00:13:51.813
Mr. Baraikin,

00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:55.053
if you're willing to cooperate with us,

00:13:55.413 --> 00:13:57.973
you can not only enjoy the investment,

00:13:59.252 --> 00:14:00.333
our company...

00:14:01.293 --> 00:14:01.892
It's okay.

00:14:02.372 --> 00:14:03.612
Let's speak Chinese.

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:07.693
Your Chinese proficiency surprises me.

00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:09.093
My wife is Chinese.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:12.053
We speak Chinese at home.

00:14:12.973 --> 00:14:13.892
Excellent.

00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:15.173
I'll continue in Chinese.

00:14:15.413 --> 00:14:15.892
Go ahead.

00:14:16.252 --> 00:14:17.053
I meant to say

00:14:17.372 --> 00:14:18.772
that if you collaborate with us,

00:14:19.093 --> 00:14:20.573
we'll increase investment

00:14:20.813 --> 00:14:21.732
and prioritize you

00:14:22.012 --> 00:14:23.973
as our crucial
overseas strategic partner.

00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:25.892
I'd consider your proposal.

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:28.372
I'll enjoy the vacation

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:29.413
with my wife in China.

00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:30.813
After that,

00:14:31.053 --> 00:14:33.333
I can visit Situo for business.

00:14:34.492 --> 00:14:35.173
Excellent.

00:14:35.652 --> 00:14:38.333
May I ask about your plans in China?

00:14:39.492 --> 00:14:40.532
If you don't mind,

00:14:40.892 --> 00:14:41.973
I could be your guide.

00:14:42.693 --> 00:14:43.372
Thank you.

00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:46.453
But our itinerary has already been set.

00:14:46.772 --> 00:14:47.693
Besides,

00:14:47.892 --> 00:14:49.372
I promised my wife

00:14:49.372 --> 00:14:50.372
not to talk business

00:14:50.732 --> 00:14:51.973
during the vacation.

00:14:53.573 --> 00:14:54.892
As you please.

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:56.652
I wish you a pleasant holiday.

00:14:59.652 --> 00:15:02.492
I bet you're still single.

00:15:03.413 --> 00:15:04.093
Yeah.

00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:06.288
Once you get married, you'll realize

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.772
that career is just
a small part of life.

00:15:09.252 --> 00:15:10.693
A man's achievement is measured

00:15:10.732 --> 00:15:12.652
not by wealth nor status,

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:15.492
but by the home he builds.

00:15:15.612 --> 00:15:16.093
Here.

00:15:17.213 --> 00:15:18.693
To men with families.

00:15:19.012 --> 00:15:19.612
Thank you.

00:15:20.093 --> 00:15:22.732
Mr. Baraikin values family deeply.

00:15:23.053 --> 00:15:25.492
He believes a man who cherishes

00:15:25.813 --> 00:15:27.573
and cares for his wife

00:15:27.772 --> 00:15:30.173
is truly wise, committed,

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:31.852
and a trustworthy partner.

00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:53.136
(Yan)

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.080
(Yan)

00:16:20.293 --> 00:16:21.053
Look.

00:16:29.813 --> 00:16:30.852
The sleeves are uneven.

00:16:30.933 --> 00:16:32.573
And here.

00:16:41.492 --> 00:16:42.173
Have some coffee.

00:16:42.973 --> 00:16:43.732
Thank you.

00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:46.492
How do you like
the shooting environment?

00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:48.053
It's great.

00:16:48.732 --> 00:16:49.973
Thank you for your support.

00:16:51.012 --> 00:16:51.573
Mr. Liang,

00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:52.652
since you're in a hurry,

00:16:52.973 --> 00:16:54.173
I've adjusted the order

00:16:54.173 --> 00:16:55.213
of the shooting.

00:16:55.372 --> 00:16:56.453
Let me brief you.

00:16:57.132 --> 00:16:59.852
We plan to start with the second set.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.532
The AC is strong. Don't catch a cold.

00:17:02.012 --> 00:17:05.812
I can show you the designs to save time.

00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:06.772
Right?

00:17:07.413 --> 00:17:08.173
Look.

00:17:08.413 --> 00:17:11.252
We intend to make this set
our flagship product.

00:17:11.693 --> 00:17:12.413
And then...

00:17:14.572 --> 00:17:16.213
When a woman becomes unoffendable,

00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:18.133
unswayable, and unshakable,

00:17:18.893 --> 00:17:21.732
she develops an irresistible charm.

00:17:24.373 --> 00:17:24.893
Mr. Liang,

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:27.213
your words flow like poetry.

00:17:28.012 --> 00:17:28.853
Remarkable.

00:17:29.012 --> 00:17:30.213
Neither of us is a fool.

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:32.693
I know men like Shen Haoming

00:17:32.693 --> 00:17:34.133
born into affluent families.

00:17:34.732 --> 00:17:36.052
They never develop

00:17:36.052 --> 00:17:37.693
genuine emotional attachments.

00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:39.572
They're shallow

00:17:42.213 --> 00:17:43.173
and heartless.

00:17:43.373 --> 00:17:44.572
But when you're together,

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:45.893
they make you feel

00:17:47.653 --> 00:17:48.653
deeply loved.

00:17:50.613 --> 00:17:52.252
You'd better free yourself from him.

00:17:52.693 --> 00:17:53.693
I'm willing to help.

00:17:53.812 --> 00:17:55.012
And I can be very generous.

00:17:55.092 --> 00:17:56.332
Please don't turn me down.

00:17:56.453 --> 00:17:56.973
I understand.

00:17:57.213 --> 00:17:58.213
I'm glad then.

00:17:58.373 --> 00:17:59.252
I'll surely become

00:17:59.252 --> 00:18:00.973
your most outstanding partner.

00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:02.492
I'll work hard.

00:18:03.052 --> 00:18:03.693
Trust me.

00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:05.133
Qiao Lin.

00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:08.532
Qiao Lin, listen.

00:18:08.732 --> 00:18:10.292
Set 1 and 3 have the same style.

00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:10.893
Charming.

00:18:11.213 --> 00:18:11.572
Yeah.

00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:12.572
I love it.

00:18:13.732 --> 00:18:14.373
Swap them.

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:15.532
Okay, then.

00:18:15.772 --> 00:18:16.173
It's fine.

00:18:16.252 --> 00:18:17.092
Only earrings left.

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:17.812
What about Guan?

00:18:17.812 --> 00:18:18.373
Same for her.

00:18:18.413 --> 00:18:19.492
This'll be quick.

00:18:20.853 --> 00:18:22.092
- I need to take this.
- Okay.

00:18:25.168 --> 00:18:26.352
(Shen Haoming)

00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:32.373
What's wrong?

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:36.092
I'm busy.

00:18:38.332 --> 00:18:39.092
I'm busy.

00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:40.413
Okay, go ahead.

00:18:47.613 --> 00:18:48.173
Yan.

00:18:49.012 --> 00:18:49.613
Who was it?

00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:52.052
Shen Haoming.

00:18:52.693 --> 00:18:53.812
What does he want?

00:18:55.973 --> 00:18:56.653
(I need)

00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:57.893
(your help.)

00:18:59.492 --> 00:19:01.092
He needs my help with something.

00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:03.853
Things are so tense right now.

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.092
Would he give you trouble?

00:19:10.812 --> 00:19:11.893
You want to see him?

00:19:13.092 --> 00:19:14.133
He reached out to me.

00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:15.653
It must be urgent.

00:19:16.413 --> 00:19:17.133
Don't worry.

00:19:17.492 --> 00:19:18.893
I'll handle it properly.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.213
Alright.

00:19:20.213 --> 00:19:21.173
Go then.

00:19:21.413 --> 00:19:22.693
You don't listen to anyone.

00:19:23.133 --> 00:19:24.012
But remember.

00:19:24.173 --> 00:19:25.933
Call me if anything happens.

00:19:27.213 --> 00:19:27.812
What for?

00:19:28.092 --> 00:19:28.973
I'll beat him up.

00:19:34.133 --> 00:19:35.492
Always so thoughtful.

00:19:36.693 --> 00:19:37.332
Go ahead.

00:19:37.893 --> 00:19:38.332
Right.

00:19:41.572 --> 00:19:42.012
Okay.

00:19:43.693 --> 00:19:44.893
Madam, hurry.

00:20:08.693 --> 00:20:09.173
Sit.

00:20:10.492 --> 00:20:11.532
It's been so long.

00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:12.492
How are you?

00:20:16.572 --> 00:20:17.252
I'm fine.

00:20:19.332 --> 00:20:20.373
How's your startup going?

00:20:22.613 --> 00:20:23.092
Sit.

00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:33.732
I'm not here for small talk.

00:20:36.213 --> 00:20:37.613
Just get to the point.

00:20:40.492 --> 00:20:41.933
I want to discuss a business deal.

00:20:43.373 --> 00:20:46.213
I know you're having funding issues.

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.052
Consider this a fundraising opportunity.

00:20:55.332 --> 00:20:57.052
You're the one in bigger trouble.

00:20:58.492 --> 00:20:59.413
You asked me for help.

00:21:00.213 --> 00:21:02.613
So don't put on that superior act.

00:21:04.492 --> 00:21:05.973
Business requires sincerity.

00:21:18.893 --> 00:21:21.492
A Russian couple in real estate

00:21:22.693 --> 00:21:23.933
is arriving soon.

00:21:25.973 --> 00:21:27.973
I want to collaborate with them

00:21:28.492 --> 00:21:30.092
to expand our overseas markets.

00:21:31.292 --> 00:21:34.572
But the husband values family greatly.

00:21:35.853 --> 00:21:38.572
I hope we can appear in front of them

00:21:39.213 --> 00:21:40.492
as spouses.

00:21:41.693 --> 00:21:44.492
Help me gain their approval.

00:21:46.532 --> 00:21:47.732
Here's their profile.

00:21:51.732 --> 00:21:53.453
We're in the cooling-off period.

00:21:54.973 --> 00:21:56.693
We're not divorced yet.

00:21:57.173 --> 00:21:57.933
Legally,

00:21:58.613 --> 00:22:00.292
we're still married.

00:22:06.613 --> 00:22:08.213
I won't ask for free help.

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:13.173
Feel free to state your terms.

00:22:25.296 --> 00:22:27.728
(Green Star Group Company Profile)

00:22:29.572 --> 00:22:30.893
How much do you make

00:22:32.012 --> 00:22:33.052
for sealing this deal?

00:22:34.613 --> 00:22:35.732
At least a billion.

00:22:47.693 --> 00:22:48.413
One million yuan.

00:22:54.252 --> 00:22:54.973
One million yuan?

00:22:55.092 --> 00:22:57.453
My help brings greater returns.

00:23:02.373 --> 00:23:03.572
If you refuse,

00:23:05.173 --> 00:23:06.173
find someone else.

00:23:08.373 --> 00:23:09.492
I meant to say

00:23:09.812 --> 00:23:11.052
the apparel industry requires

00:23:11.052 --> 00:23:12.012
heavy investment.

00:23:12.413 --> 00:23:14.532
A million alone won't make a splash.

00:23:16.893 --> 00:23:17.613
Here's the deal.

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.973
I'll invest 10 million as a shareholder.

00:23:21.532 --> 00:23:23.492
I don't want your investment.

00:23:24.213 --> 00:23:25.812
This is an equal partnership.

00:23:26.133 --> 00:23:27.413
I'll only take my fee.

00:23:27.732 --> 00:23:29.812
I don't need anything else.

00:23:40.292 --> 00:23:40.772
Okay.

00:23:41.973 --> 00:23:42.893
Deal.

00:23:43.893 --> 00:23:45.973
One million yuan as your fee.

00:23:47.012 --> 00:23:48.413
But remember this.

00:23:48.653 --> 00:23:51.252
Mr. Baraikin values
marital bonds deeply.

00:23:51.653 --> 00:23:53.252
We need to look like

00:23:53.252 --> 00:23:55.012
the most loving couple.

00:23:58.332 --> 00:23:59.133
To our partnership.

00:24:03.492 --> 00:24:04.292
To our partnership.

00:24:31.772 --> 00:24:33.332
The outfit I picked for you look nice.

00:24:34.532 --> 00:24:35.213
Hello.

00:24:37.772 --> 00:24:38.332
Baby.

00:24:38.532 --> 00:24:39.572
Where are our IDs?

00:24:45.292 --> 00:24:46.213
Weren't you the one

00:24:46.213 --> 00:24:47.492
keeping them all along?

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:49.213
My job is just to enjoy myself.

00:24:51.572 --> 00:24:52.292
It's my fault.

00:24:52.853 --> 00:24:53.893
I keep forgetting things.

00:24:54.492 --> 00:24:56.052
If we can't check in today,

00:24:56.292 --> 00:24:58.613
we'll have to camp outside.

00:24:58.772 --> 00:25:00.492
Then we'll sleep in a tent,

00:25:00.853 --> 00:25:02.213
watch stars and the moon,

00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:05.332
and have a barbecue.

00:25:07.213 --> 00:25:08.252
Sir, your room key.

00:25:08.332 --> 00:25:08.933
Thank you.

00:25:09.933 --> 00:25:10.453
Come on.

00:25:10.453 --> 00:25:12.812
This couple seems so in love.

00:25:13.492 --> 00:25:14.973
But I don't like Barbie.

00:25:15.133 --> 00:25:18.893
I prefer Twilight romance.

00:25:27.133 --> 00:25:27.973
Plan B.

00:26:14.252 --> 00:26:15.332
Excuse me.

00:26:20.893 --> 00:26:21.933
Excuse me.

00:26:28.052 --> 00:26:28.653
Look.

00:26:29.012 --> 00:26:30.973
These guys look like Edward and Bella.

00:26:31.052 --> 00:26:31.853
Yeah.

00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:34.532
That's my favorite love story.

00:26:34.772 --> 00:26:35.933
You used to watch it a lot.

00:26:35.933 --> 00:26:37.572
Yeah, once a week.

00:26:42.572 --> 00:26:43.173
Excuse me.

00:26:43.613 --> 00:26:44.332
Which floor?

00:26:50.973 --> 00:26:51.653
Same.

00:27:01.532 --> 00:27:02.173
Thank you.

00:27:06.012 --> 00:27:06.732
This way, please.

00:27:08.893 --> 00:27:10.492
Your room's at the end of this hall.

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.252
Please give me a second.

00:27:16.893 --> 00:27:18.532
Excuse me, please.

00:27:20.413 --> 00:27:21.653
Thank you. This way, please.

00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:29.772
Almost there.

00:27:35.732 --> 00:27:36.492
Here.

00:27:42.693 --> 00:27:44.413
Enjoy your vacation.

00:27:51.292 --> 00:27:53.413
May I ask which room you're staying in?

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:56.213
What floor is this?

00:27:57.052 --> 00:27:57.812
The second floor.

00:27:58.812 --> 00:27:59.952
We're on the third floor.

00:28:06.693 --> 00:28:07.653
Plan C.

00:28:50.572 --> 00:28:51.532
We have a room.

00:28:53.653 --> 00:28:54.173
Second floor.

00:28:55.572 --> 00:28:57.453
I wish you a pleasant stay.

00:28:58.492 --> 00:28:58.933
Please.

00:29:05.332 --> 00:29:06.772
Enjoy your stay.

00:29:07.492 --> 00:29:08.492
Thank you.

00:29:18.693 --> 00:29:19.252
Hello.

00:29:19.772 --> 00:29:22.173
Please send the priciest romance package

00:29:22.292 --> 00:29:23.492
to Room 2132.

00:29:24.092 --> 00:29:25.772
Make sure the cake says

00:29:25.933 --> 00:29:27.092
"I love you" on it.

00:29:27.772 --> 00:29:28.292
Thank you.

00:29:58.893 --> 00:29:59.453
Sir, your cake

00:29:59.572 --> 00:30:01.453
and champagne are here.

00:30:04.373 --> 00:30:06.973
But we didn't order this.

00:30:07.532 --> 00:30:07.973
But...

00:30:08.133 --> 00:30:10.292
This is Room 2132.

00:30:11.292 --> 00:30:12.653
It looks amazing.

00:30:12.973 --> 00:30:14.973
Honey, is this a surprise for me?

00:30:15.012 --> 00:30:16.252
Thank you, darling.

00:30:17.252 --> 00:30:18.092
Stop acting.

00:30:18.092 --> 00:30:19.133
I'm so happy.

00:30:20.332 --> 00:30:22.572
Please charge it to my room.

00:30:22.933 --> 00:30:24.092
Let me bring it inside.

00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:24.933
Thank you.

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:34.772
He's gone.

00:30:55.532 --> 00:30:57.532
This cake is so good.

00:30:57.572 --> 00:30:58.973
Thank you, honey.

00:31:00.012 --> 00:31:01.732
Have more if you like it.

00:31:03.292 --> 00:31:03.772
Okay.

00:31:04.893 --> 00:31:05.292
Made it.

00:31:09.732 --> 00:31:10.252
Hello.

00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:11.292
May I help you?

00:31:11.973 --> 00:31:13.973
We ordered a romance package

00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:15.453
and I think the waiter

00:31:15.653 --> 00:31:17.012
brought it to your room.

00:31:17.933 --> 00:31:19.133
Oh, it was yours?

00:31:20.413 --> 00:31:21.413
I'm so sorry.

00:31:23.973 --> 00:31:25.092
We've already...

00:31:27.332 --> 00:31:29.532
I'm sorry, I already took a bite.

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:36.613
I'm sorry, I...

00:31:36.613 --> 00:31:38.213
- Hello.
- I already took a bite.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:42.732
It's okay.

00:31:43.373 --> 00:31:44.492
No need to apologize.

00:31:45.853 --> 00:31:47.373
A beautiful cake like this

00:31:47.812 --> 00:31:49.453
is meant for a beautiful lady.

00:31:49.613 --> 00:31:50.133
Sorry.

00:31:50.613 --> 00:31:52.052
My wife seemed delighted.

00:31:52.092 --> 00:31:53.012
So we accepted it.

00:31:54.252 --> 00:31:54.973
I'm sorry.

00:31:55.292 --> 00:31:56.252
Me too.

00:31:57.812 --> 00:31:58.933
You are so in love.

00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:01.933
You're a great role model
for young couples like us.

00:32:04.012 --> 00:32:05.693
We won't disturb you. Let's go.

00:32:06.012 --> 00:32:06.693
Wait.

00:32:07.332 --> 00:32:09.772
How about the four of us share it?

00:32:09.812 --> 00:32:10.893
There's champagne too.

00:32:12.572 --> 00:32:13.693
This kind of cake

00:32:14.693 --> 00:32:15.893
is only meant for a couple.

00:32:16.853 --> 00:32:17.772
How about this, honey?

00:32:18.492 --> 00:32:19.213
Tonight,

00:32:19.572 --> 00:32:21.092
I'll take you to the hotel lawn.

00:32:22.133 --> 00:32:24.853
They're known for their shows.

00:32:26.133 --> 00:32:27.373
So romantic.

00:32:28.213 --> 00:32:29.492
You're also going to the lawn?

00:32:31.133 --> 00:32:33.893
Then let's have a drink later.

00:32:34.812 --> 00:32:35.492
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:32:36.252 --> 00:32:37.133
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

00:32:42.332 --> 00:32:43.052
Take the bed.

00:32:43.772 --> 00:32:44.532
I'll take the sofa.

00:32:44.653 --> 00:32:45.373
Okay, thanks.

00:32:56.532 --> 00:32:58.413
That cake was a good idea.

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:15.532
Unpack your own stuff.

00:33:50.864 --> 00:33:54.608
♪I just wanna take my time tonight♪

00:33:59.492 --> 00:34:00.092
Over here.

00:34:01.492 --> 00:34:02.092
Hello.

00:34:02.492 --> 00:34:03.973
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

00:34:04.893 --> 00:34:06.492
Let me introduce myself.

00:34:07.012 --> 00:34:08.212
I'm Shen Haoming.

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:11.492
This is my wife, Xu Yan.

00:34:11.572 --> 00:34:12.413
I'm Baraikin.

00:34:12.492 --> 00:34:12.893
Hello.

00:34:13.052 --> 00:34:13.813
This is my wife.

00:34:13.893 --> 00:34:14.652
Hello.

00:34:15.652 --> 00:34:16.172
Over here.

00:34:16.172 --> 00:34:16.692
This way.

00:34:16.692 --> 00:34:18.532
- You speak fluent Chinese.
- What a nice dress.

00:34:18.853 --> 00:34:19.652
Horse-face skirt.

00:34:19.692 --> 00:34:20.973
I'll get you one if you like.

00:34:21.052 --> 00:34:21.893
Yes, please!

00:34:22.509 --> 00:34:25.222
♪When the time is right♪

00:34:26.853 --> 00:34:27.492
Perfect.

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:28.652
Beautiful weather today.

00:34:29.212 --> 00:34:29.532
Indeed.

00:34:33.172 --> 00:34:33.520
Here.

00:34:33.612 --> 00:34:34.092
Thank you.

00:34:40.092 --> 00:34:40.652
Cheers.

00:34:40.813 --> 00:34:41.733
Cheers.

00:34:42.733 --> 00:34:44.333
After the wonderful performances,

00:34:44.492 --> 00:34:47.492
let's move on to the game session.

00:34:47.773 --> 00:34:49.893
Couples in Sync Challenge.

00:34:50.092 --> 00:34:51.492
We've prepared

00:34:51.492 --> 00:34:53.652
various games

00:34:53.893 --> 00:34:55.853
for couples.

00:34:56.172 --> 00:34:58.413
Let's see if you can
complete the challenges.

00:34:58.572 --> 00:34:59.893
Those who succeed

00:35:00.413 --> 00:35:02.373
will receive fabulous prizes.

00:35:02.692 --> 00:35:05.012
Who wants to go first

00:35:05.733 --> 00:35:07.652
and take the challenge?

00:35:09.652 --> 00:35:10.492
Excuse me.

00:35:10.532 --> 00:35:12.612
Why are you leaving?

00:35:12.893 --> 00:35:14.612
Are you scared that you might not

00:35:14.773 --> 00:35:15.773
be in sync?

00:35:16.492 --> 00:35:17.973
This looks fun. I want to try.

00:35:18.132 --> 00:35:18.612
Here.

00:35:19.773 --> 00:35:21.413
We have international guests too.

00:35:21.813 --> 00:35:23.652
Let's welcome them with applause.

00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:29.253
Let's try later too.

00:35:32.212 --> 00:35:33.933
It's called "Couples in Sync."

00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:35.293
How are we in sync?

00:35:35.853 --> 00:35:37.333
You Act, I Guess.

00:35:37.532 --> 00:35:38.933
Ready, go.

00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:40.532
Fine, then forget it.

00:35:41.253 --> 00:35:42.572
First question.

00:35:43.253 --> 00:35:43.973
Two words.

00:35:44.656 --> 00:35:46.128
(Sun Wukong)

00:35:46.492 --> 00:35:47.813
Let's see if you can guess it.

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:48.733
(Sun Wukong)
Monkey.

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:50.652
- Sun Wukong.
- Two words.

00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:52.373
Correct. Congratulations.

00:35:52.413 --> 00:35:53.172
Excellent.

00:35:53.172 --> 00:35:54.293
Alright, next question.

00:35:56.132 --> 00:35:56.532
Nice.

00:35:57.293 --> 00:35:58.492
Okay, two words.

00:36:01.733 --> 00:36:02.973
Show us your interpretation.

00:36:04.052 --> 00:36:05.532
Very vivid.

00:36:05.973 --> 00:36:06.692
(Giant Panda)
Two words.

00:36:07.052 --> 00:36:07.652
Big bear.

00:36:08.813 --> 00:36:09.652
Giant panda.

00:36:09.813 --> 00:36:11.492
Correct. Congratulations.

00:36:11.612 --> 00:36:12.692
Brilliant.

00:36:12.893 --> 00:36:13.773
Our foreign friend

00:36:13.773 --> 00:36:15.773
has a deep understanding
of Chinese culture.

00:36:16.012 --> 00:36:17.532
You're doing so well.

00:36:17.733 --> 00:36:18.853
We applaud you.

00:36:18.853 --> 00:36:19.373
Excellent.

00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:21.012
Okay, next question.

00:36:22.092 --> 00:36:23.052
Also two words.

00:36:24.733 --> 00:36:25.973
What's happening here?

00:36:27.212 --> 00:36:27.813
Okay.

00:36:30.172 --> 00:36:30.933
Dancing.

00:36:31.532 --> 00:36:32.492
Two words.

00:36:33.253 --> 00:36:33.893
Jump.

00:36:34.172 --> 00:36:34.733
What...

00:36:36.253 --> 00:36:36.973
Swing.

00:36:37.492 --> 00:36:38.212
Yangge dancing.

00:36:38.492 --> 00:36:40.092
Congratulations, that's correct.

00:36:40.612 --> 00:36:41.212
What is this?

00:36:41.212 --> 00:36:42.212
You got everything right.

00:36:42.373 --> 00:36:43.092
It's quite windy.

00:36:43.092 --> 00:36:43.572
Brilliant.

00:36:43.572 --> 00:36:44.853
Next question.

00:36:47.532 --> 00:36:48.132
Everyone.

00:36:48.492 --> 00:36:49.333
Two words.

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:50.492
Still two words.

00:36:51.492 --> 00:36:52.212
There's no wind.

00:36:53.492 --> 00:36:55.413
Didn't you agree to cooperate?

00:36:56.052 --> 00:36:57.492
Why don't you try to appreciate

00:36:57.532 --> 00:36:58.492
your husband?

00:36:58.692 --> 00:36:59.973
Tai Chi.

00:37:00.413 --> 00:37:03.172
Congratulations again.

00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:04.492
A loving couple

00:37:04.492 --> 00:37:05.773
wouldn't show off in public.

00:37:06.212 --> 00:37:07.492
Don't you understand?

00:37:18.012 --> 00:37:18.933
The wife acting up

00:37:18.933 --> 00:37:20.132
is a part of the dynamic.

00:37:20.572 --> 00:37:21.572
Watch your attitude.

00:37:24.973 --> 00:37:27.373
You can act up,
but don't cross the line, okay?

00:37:30.572 --> 00:37:31.333
Are you upset?

00:37:32.893 --> 00:37:34.092
Replace me then.

00:37:34.572 --> 00:37:35.532
I'll just quit.

00:37:36.413 --> 00:37:38.733
Don't forget we have a contract.

00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:41.612
It's mutually binding.

00:37:42.212 --> 00:37:43.492
I'm not your subordinate.

00:37:43.733 --> 00:37:46.092
Don't order me around like before.

00:37:50.253 --> 00:37:51.933
Congratulations, that's correct.

00:37:52.492 --> 00:37:53.492
Amazing.

00:37:53.973 --> 00:37:55.373
They're so in sync.

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:55.773
Okay.

00:37:55.813 --> 00:37:57.933
Let's proceed to the next part.

00:37:58.212 --> 00:37:58.933
Bring the towels.

00:38:07.933 --> 00:38:09.572
Unentangle the towels.

00:38:09.572 --> 00:38:10.893
It's a simple game.

00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:12.333
Let's see what happens.

00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:14.293
It's impossible to communicate with you.

00:38:14.373 --> 00:38:16.132
Then let's stop communicating.

00:38:17.492 --> 00:38:18.733
Focus on your task.

00:38:18.733 --> 00:38:20.652
Another round of applause for them!

00:38:22.172 --> 00:38:24.012
Why do you think we're getting divorced?

00:38:24.893 --> 00:38:26.893
If you can't find the right approach,

00:38:27.293 --> 00:38:28.492
try different methods.

00:38:30.373 --> 00:38:32.052
Try different approaches

00:38:32.092 --> 00:38:33.893
to get the towels unentangled.

00:38:33.893 --> 00:38:35.212
Because you used me.

00:38:37.773 --> 00:38:38.692
Didn't you use me?

00:38:38.893 --> 00:38:40.253
But I truly love you.

00:38:47.212 --> 00:38:48.212
Loved you.

00:38:50.773 --> 00:38:51.692
I helped you too.

00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:53.492
That means, to you,

00:38:53.492 --> 00:38:55.692
our relationship was nothing

00:38:55.692 --> 00:38:58.413
but a transaction all along, right?

00:38:58.612 --> 00:39:00.773
I don't think we need to
reach this point.

00:39:00.773 --> 00:39:01.612
What do you mean?

00:39:02.813 --> 00:39:03.612
Want to reconcile?

00:39:08.532 --> 00:39:09.612
I've tried.

00:39:10.293 --> 00:39:10.973
Did it work?

00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:15.692
It's too late.

00:39:16.492 --> 00:39:17.612
I just want to tell you

00:39:17.692 --> 00:39:19.893
that being with me will benefit you.

00:39:20.012 --> 00:39:21.092
Your current business

00:39:21.132 --> 00:39:22.293
will waste your money.

00:39:22.333 --> 00:39:23.532
Only I can save you, okay?

00:39:23.532 --> 00:39:24.853
Why do you overestimate yourself?

00:39:25.492 --> 00:39:26.973
And why do you belittle me?

00:39:28.853 --> 00:39:30.293
You think no one wants to fund me?

00:39:30.652 --> 00:39:31.413
Listen carefully.

00:39:31.612 --> 00:39:33.652
Investors are lining up.

00:39:33.973 --> 00:39:34.813
Want to invest?

00:39:35.253 --> 00:39:36.052
Get in line.

00:39:37.293 --> 00:39:38.352
Who's investing in you?

00:39:39.853 --> 00:39:40.492
Tell me.

00:39:40.652 --> 00:39:41.532
Stop talking.

00:39:42.733 --> 00:39:43.293
Yan.

00:39:46.373 --> 00:39:47.652
Look, this is my trophy.

00:39:47.933 --> 00:39:48.893
So cute.

00:39:48.933 --> 00:39:49.492
Yeah.

00:39:49.572 --> 00:39:51.212
Would you like to give it a try?

00:39:51.212 --> 00:39:51.612
It's fun.

00:39:51.612 --> 00:39:52.172
Us?

00:39:52.373 --> 00:39:53.373
It's really fun.

00:39:54.853 --> 00:39:55.813
Want to try, honey?

00:39:59.092 --> 00:39:59.612
Alright.

00:40:00.373 --> 00:40:01.733
The next game is called:

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:03.172
"Which Way to Look?

00:40:03.253 --> 00:40:04.293
One, Two, Three."

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.333
It's another test to see if the couples

00:40:06.333 --> 00:40:07.373
are in sync.

00:40:07.652 --> 00:40:09.853
Please listen to my command.

00:40:10.012 --> 00:40:11.012
After I say,

00:40:11.253 --> 00:40:13.052
"Which way to look? One, two, three,"

00:40:13.132 --> 00:40:14.612
turn your heads.

00:40:14.893 --> 00:40:16.933
If you turn in the same direction,

00:40:16.973 --> 00:40:17.773
you win.

00:40:17.933 --> 00:40:20.813
Otherwise, you will
receive a punishment.

00:40:21.132 --> 00:40:21.652
Now,

00:40:21.692 --> 00:40:23.092
there's water on the table.

00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:25.532
Whoever grabs it first

00:40:25.813 --> 00:40:27.413
can splash the other.

00:40:32.652 --> 00:40:34.012
Who's your investor?

00:40:36.293 --> 00:40:37.413
Focus on the game.

00:40:42.212 --> 00:40:43.933
Ready, go.

00:40:44.293 --> 00:40:45.293
Which way to look?

00:40:45.492 --> 00:40:46.052
One.

00:40:46.492 --> 00:40:47.253
Two.

00:40:47.532 --> 00:40:48.212
Three.

00:40:55.212 --> 00:40:56.373
I didn't make the rules.

00:40:56.933 --> 00:40:57.692
It's fine.

00:40:58.132 --> 00:40:59.092
I understand.

00:41:05.692 --> 00:41:06.572
Which way to look?

00:41:06.813 --> 00:41:07.492
One.

00:41:07.813 --> 00:41:08.532
Two.

00:41:08.813 --> 00:41:09.492
Three.

00:41:38.373 --> 00:41:39.893
We were in sync.

00:41:42.092 --> 00:41:42.973
Sorry.

00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:44.652
I got confused.

00:41:46.253 --> 00:41:46.973
It's okay.

00:41:48.052 --> 00:41:48.733
I understand.

00:41:55.973 --> 00:41:57.253
(Robot)
You Act, I Guess.

00:41:57.333 --> 00:41:58.733
Ready, go.

00:42:00.572 --> 00:42:01.413
One word.

00:42:02.172 --> 00:42:03.253
Watch the details.

00:42:04.012 --> 00:42:05.012
What is he doing?

00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:07.212
Seniors.

00:42:08.212 --> 00:42:09.172
Wrong guess.

00:42:11.692 --> 00:42:13.413
Try acting differently.

00:42:18.012 --> 00:42:18.933
Great dancing.

00:42:19.012 --> 00:42:19.933
Poping?

00:42:21.733 --> 00:42:22.813
Getting warmer.

00:42:26.132 --> 00:42:27.132
Robot.

00:42:27.692 --> 00:42:29.413
Correct. Well done.

00:42:29.612 --> 00:42:30.253
Excellent.

00:42:30.293 --> 00:42:31.492
Next question.

00:42:33.373 --> 00:42:34.492
Ready, go.

00:42:35.025 --> 00:42:36.112
(Electric fan)

00:42:36.813 --> 00:42:37.492
What's this?

00:42:40.733 --> 00:42:41.492
Electric fan.

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.092
You got it.

00:42:43.132 --> 00:42:43.813
Fantastic.

00:42:43.893 --> 00:42:45.132
You're reading his mind.

00:42:45.492 --> 00:42:46.853
Swap positions now.

00:42:47.172 --> 00:42:49.413
Let's see how you'll do next.

00:42:49.492 --> 00:42:51.132
Everyone, applause please.

00:42:52.333 --> 00:42:54.773
Thanks. I believe
they will do even better.

00:42:55.052 --> 00:42:57.333
(Hide)
Next question. Go.

00:43:00.172 --> 00:43:00.692
Four letters.

00:43:00.692 --> 00:43:01.572
Okay.

00:43:02.733 --> 00:43:03.212
Second one.

00:43:04.132 --> 00:43:04.652
Up.

00:43:06.492 --> 00:43:07.172
Fourth one.

00:43:08.973 --> 00:43:09.532
Down.

00:43:10.853 --> 00:43:11.413
Swim.

00:43:11.572 --> 00:43:12.172
Swim.

00:43:16.773 --> 00:43:17.492
Lookout.

00:43:17.813 --> 00:43:18.413
Observation.

00:43:20.333 --> 00:43:21.212
Next one, please.

00:43:21.293 --> 00:43:21.652
(Hide)
Okay.

00:43:21.853 --> 00:43:22.773
(Sauerkraut fish)
Next question.

00:43:25.333 --> 00:43:25.813
Two words.

00:43:25.813 --> 00:43:26.333
Two words.

00:43:29.293 --> 00:43:32.413
Is she cooking?

00:43:35.172 --> 00:43:36.333
Tastes bad.

00:43:36.492 --> 00:43:37.853
Final countdown.

00:43:38.253 --> 00:43:38.813
Five...

00:43:40.212 --> 00:43:40.973
Cut.

00:43:41.293 --> 00:43:42.052
Four...

00:43:43.572 --> 00:43:44.333
Three...

00:43:44.893 --> 00:43:45.373
Two words.

00:43:45.692 --> 00:43:46.293
Swim.

00:43:46.373 --> 00:43:46.933
Swimming.

00:43:47.253 --> 00:43:47.652
Two...

00:43:47.733 --> 00:43:48.293
Skip, please.

00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:48.773
Okay.

00:43:48.933 --> 00:43:50.333
Alright, next question.

00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:51.092
(Band-Aid)

00:43:51.092 --> 00:43:52.652
Get this one correctly,

00:43:52.652 --> 00:43:55.212
and you'll win the game and the prize.

00:43:55.333 --> 00:43:56.652
(Band-Aid)
Let's see if they can win.

00:43:56.692 --> 00:43:57.052
Okay.

00:43:57.172 --> 00:43:57.773
Ready,

00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:58.492
go.

00:44:01.092 --> 00:44:02.532
The nurse removed the needle.

00:44:02.893 --> 00:44:04.144
I feared you'd keep bleeding,

00:44:04.253 --> 00:44:05.572
so applied a band-aid.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.576
(Band-Aid)

00:44:14.692 --> 00:44:15.492
How many characters?

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:16.893
If you don't start,

00:44:16.973 --> 00:44:18.373
(Band-Aid)
we'll start the countdown.

00:44:19.612 --> 00:44:20.172
Okay.

00:44:20.333 --> 00:44:21.293
Hurry.

00:44:21.373 --> 00:44:22.212
We're out of time.

00:44:22.733 --> 00:44:23.532
Four.

00:44:26.413 --> 00:44:27.212
- Three.
- Come on.

00:44:27.813 --> 00:44:28.333
Xu Yan.

00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:28.893
Two.

00:44:32.933 --> 00:44:33.612
Band-Aid.

00:44:34.212 --> 00:44:36.012
Congratulations. The answer is correct.

00:44:36.012 --> 00:44:36.496
(Band-Aid)

00:44:36.612 --> 00:44:38.012
That's incredible.

00:44:38.172 --> 00:44:39.572
At the last second,

00:44:39.893 --> 00:44:41.692
you actually got it right.

00:44:41.773 --> 00:44:42.853
And that gesture

00:44:42.893 --> 00:44:44.253
she made was so simple.

00:44:45.132 --> 00:44:46.413
They're 100 percent

00:44:46.532 --> 00:44:47.413
in sync.

00:44:47.472 --> 00:44:48.528
A round of applause.

00:44:49.813 --> 00:44:50.773
