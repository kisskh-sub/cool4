00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.560
Have you told Banjong yet?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.640
Told him what?

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.000
That we’re a couple now.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.360
Banjong

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120
I have something to tell you.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520
I don't love...

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.320
Banjong, Banjong

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.600
Somdet's army is coming

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.080
Everyone, take your posts

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.720
And follow the plan

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.240
You must surrender

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.160
If not, I'll have you all killed

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.320
Didn't I tell you?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.560
I told you to stay still.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.880
Don't risk yourself. Is it that hard?

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.000
Fine. I've put my brother in your care

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.520
So do it properly

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.960
I'll come back to inspect later

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160
No need.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.080
I'll take better care than you would.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.680
Worradej

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400
Could I have some water?

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.640
Thanks.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.960
Eat a little more, okay?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.440
Worradej

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.560
Worradej, where are you?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.520
I'm here to take you home.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.600
After I shaved my topknot.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.880
I haven't bathed with anyone since then.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.240
So I feel kind of embarrassed.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.680
Why are you embarrassed?

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.440
Don't be embarrassed.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.320
You can't even see, can you?

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.079
If you can't see, no need to be shy.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.280
It's perfectly warm.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.320
I'll dry you off.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.480
Wow.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.240
No surprise.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.480
Why Worradej is so in love with Banjong

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.320
Glasses make him handsome.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.680
Without the glasses,
you’re ten times more handsome.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.960
Look.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.440
Small mouth, prominent nose.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.360
Sorrowful eyes.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.960
What if I accidentally kissed him?

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.960
Wait.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.760
What am I doing?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.520
But look at his lips.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.760
Wait.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.280
What's wrong with me?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.480
Why can't I hold myself back?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.840
Wor, you witch

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.920
Are you possessing me?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.920
But this is your body anyway.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.000
Wait, Wor

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.320
Don't come back into the body now.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.320
What are you two doing?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.280
Why is Banjong naked in front of you?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.200
I...

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.920
Calm down, Kosol.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.640
I was just helping him bathe.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.040
Why bathe him? Are you his mom?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.400
He's grown up, not a kid anymore.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.920
And you're still bathing him?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.160
Banjong lost his glasses. He can’t see well.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.360
I just helped him. What's the harm?

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.760
Just no glasses, not blind.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.200
I say he’s just making excuses to touch you.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.600
Hey.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.160
He didn’t ask me to bathe him.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.200
I volunteered myself.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.680
Earlier, he even grabbed my hand
thinking it was the dipper.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.800
Is that true, Banjong?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.480
No wonder... the dipper felt soft and pale.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.440
Hey, stop right now, Kosol.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.600
How could you hurt him like that?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.400
Banjong is injured.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.840
Besides, he can't see.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.800
Show some compassion for others.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.880
And stop being so needlessly jealous.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.880
You two are in this state together.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.400
How could I not be jealous?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.600
I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.480
That Banjong can't see.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.840
And I was only going to bathe him.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.240
Fine.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.920
You're not good at bathing, are you?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840
What are you doing, Kosol?

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.440
Kosol!

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.400
Stop it.
I'm bathing you, Banjong, you sly one.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.240
Ow, my wound.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.120
Have you lost your mind?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.960
Are you satisfied now?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.320
My wound.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.120
Go home.
Let go.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.800
I told you to let go.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.040
Let go.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.800
Please, go back.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.360
I'll sleep here tonight.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360
Will you walk back
or must I carry you?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.200
Hey, stop it.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.480
Didn't I tell you?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.240
You have no right to carry me
unless I allow it.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.920
Think being big and strong
lets you carry anyone anytime?

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.080
So you insist on staying here.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.600
To let Banjong fawn all over you?

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.800
Think whatever you want.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.560
I'm tired, I'm annoyed.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.440
I’m done arguing with you.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.800
Wait.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.040
Hey.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.480
Even if you hate what I did
with Banjong.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.640
I need you to know.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.360
I did it because I love you.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.240
Don’t justify violence with love.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.120
Love is love.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.760
But you have no right to use love
as an excuse to hurt others.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.480
I don’t know.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.240
What you’ve been through
to become this way.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.040
But people.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.240
If they know right from wrong.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.800
They should choose to change
and make it right.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.120
It’s up to you.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.640
Whether you will or not.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.200
Mumu

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.120
You were born fierce

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.640
so other animals would fear you

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.200
and you'd survive this cruel world

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.880
But let me ask you something

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.360
If one day your lover

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.480
is taken by another tiger

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.480
wouldn't you maul its throat to get them back?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.080
So what did I do wrong

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.000
for being fierce?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.040
It's because I want to protect my love

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.320
But you're human, not a tiger

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.080
Why are you here?

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.760
Sitting to watch someone heartbroken

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.840
and end up pouring their heart out to a tiger

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.560
- Chet
- Oh

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.360
Not fierce at all

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.080
I was bored, so I asked Jade to stay a night

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.080
I happened to overhear you pouring your heart out to Mumu

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720
What did you just say?

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.760
We're human, not tigers, right?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.880
Right

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.200
Tigers,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.600
when they fight over food or mates

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.600
they'll use force to maul each other

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.680
But we’re human. We can talk it out.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.320
If you like or dislike something.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.680
If you want or don’t want him to do something.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.520
You just have to say it straight.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.160
But if saying it straight doesn’t work.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.480
You shouldn’t force him.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.120
Because once it’s forced.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.080
You’ll never win his heart.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.520
You’ve really grown up.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.920
Come sit with me.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.600
Uh...

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.320
You said we’re friends, right?

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.800
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.920
Uh.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.200
Your Majesty.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.760
What you just said was so good, Your Majesty.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.320
Like you’ve had so much experience in love.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.600
Uh...

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.120
Your Majesty.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.040
Please don’t be offended, Your Majesty.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.960
Have you ever been in love, Your Majesty?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.520
I’ve told you before.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.000
And I asked you this question before too.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.280
But you fell asleep first.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.880
I’ve never been in love.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.040
What I just said to Brother Kosol.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.880
I read it all from books.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.120
I’ve never been in love either, Your Majesty.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.840
We’re true companions.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.920
Even in matters of the heart,
we’re both still alone.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.440
But you’re the King.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.400
Finding a partner shouldn’t be hard.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.440
Who would ever want to be with me?

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.480
I could search a lifetime
and still not find someone.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.160
You will.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.800
You’re someone who cares about others.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.280
Anyone would want you in their life.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.400
Me on the other hand.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.480
I’ve become nothing but trouble.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.120
No one would want to stay with me.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.680
But I enjoy being with you, Your Majesty.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.920
It’s exciting. I never get bored, Your Majesty.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.720
Then shall we make a promise?

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.800
If we grow old and still can’t find wives.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.760
We’ll stay single and be friends forever.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.640
Hey.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.680
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.640
Wow.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.360
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.600
Friends.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.560
Come up.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.680
Why are you so tense?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.280
Your wound should be dry now.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.360
Anyway, I apologize for Kosol.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.360
Don’t hold it against him.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.960
I know him well.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.840
I’ve suffered from him plenty.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.760
He’s been like this forever.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.480
But from now on, you need to fight back.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.600
Don’t let him be the only one acting.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.720
With what can I fight?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200
I’m no warrior.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.960
Kosol’s strong like a wild bear.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.440
While I’m just a puppy.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.320
A baby-dog type.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.280
But if Kosol bullies you again.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.000
Come tell me right away.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.720
I’ll raise hell for you.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.800
Worradej.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.400
The world needs people like you.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.440
People who don’t stay silent at wrongs.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.640
That’s why I like you.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.960
I’m not that good.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.520
I just...

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.240
can’t stand seeing injustice.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.080
Go get some sleep.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.080
I’ll go to bed soon too.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.040
If you need anything tonight,
just call out for me.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.480
Sweet dreams.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.320
Worradej.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.600
Can you sleep with me tonight?

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.120
Look at those eyes.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.000
Should I just sleep with Banjong for one night?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.640
Wait, Wor.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.360
Are you trying to control my thoughts again?

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.360
If I sleep with Banjong tonight.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.880
The ghost will push for sure.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.040
Stop, you have to stop.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.280
And get out of my head right now.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.920
Uh, well...

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.920
I toss and turn when I sleep.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.480
I toss and turn a lot. If I fall asleep.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.680
My arm might hit your wound.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.400
It could make things worse.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.880
I’m going now.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.160
Prince, repeat it to yourself.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.320
You’ve got a man already, you’ve got a man.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.800
But...

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.000
Let me ask you something.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.520
Earlier, when you said that...

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.360
Me before I took the poison
and after I took it.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.280
It feels like I’m two different people.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.040
So which one do you love?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.720
Don’t trouble yourself, Worradej.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.240
Be however you wish to be.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.320
Just stay true to yourself.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.560
That’s the you I love.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.200
Even if you hate what I did with Banjong.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.320
I need you to know.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.080
I did it because I love you.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.160
Love is love.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.960
But you can’t use love
as an excuse to hurt others.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.520
I don’t know.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.480
What you’ve been through
to become this way.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.960
But people,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.520
if they know right from wrong.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.480
They should choose to change
and make it right.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.760
It’s up to you
whether you will or not.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.640
Have you lost your mind?

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.240
Are you satisfied now?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.760
My wound.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.320
Pandao.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.080
What are you doing?

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.320
Probably washing clothes.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.440
Sorry.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.200
I asked the wrong thing.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.560
I meant to ask what chili paste
you’re pounding.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.440
Hell chili paste.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.800
I have to cook for my brother.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.200
If I let you do it,
he couldn’t eat it.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.920
He’d starve before his wound heals.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.680
And I’ll bring some to Brother Kosol too.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.280
Then when you’re done.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.440
Please feed some to Banjong too.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.840
I’m heading back.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.160
Really?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.360
Good. Go then.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.160
The sooner the better.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.840
I’ll take care of my brother myself.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.160
Then I’ll leave it to you.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.080
I have to get back to Kosol.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.040
Don’t go yet.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.480
Let me ask you something.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.720
Why suddenly don’t you want
to tend to Brother Banjong?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.400
You’re the reason he got hurt.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.320
You know Banjong likes me, right?

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.200
Mm, well...

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.840
I had some idea.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.360
But I don’t see him
as more than a friend.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.320
I don’t want him
to think too far beyond that.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.800
If I treat him too kindly.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.800
It’ll feel like giving him hope.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.520
The longer it goes, the harder to fix.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.560
Let me ask you straight.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.800
You and Brother Kosol,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.840
are you together?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.880
Together, as in...

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.520
you mean lovers?

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.320
As in a couple?

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.280
Mm.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.360
Yes.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.800
We confessed our love.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.840
And decided to be together.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.040
Pandao.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.560
What’s wrong?

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.200
Nothing, I’m fine.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.840
Chili and garlic got in my eyes.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.960
You like Kosol too, don’t you?

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.000
I can tell.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.640
You cook really well.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.160
But if you give it
to someone who doesn’t want it.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.480
It won’t taste good to them.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.960
Keep your cooking.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.360
Give it to someone who wants it.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.600
Here, Worradej.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.120
Is the food ready?

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.760
It’s not Worradej.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.640
It’s me.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.360
Then where did Worradej go?

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.200
Why didn’t he bring it himself?

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.760
He’s the one who has to feed me anyway.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.360
Brother Banjong.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.400
You’re handsome.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.120
You’ve got a good nature.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.960
And you’re knowledgeable.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.640
You should find someone
who truly values you.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.560
As for me, I’ll find someone who,

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.200
appreciates my chili paste.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.320
What are you saying?

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.120
I don’t understand.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.720
Explain it clearly to me.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.560
Worradej told me.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.640
He and Brother Kosol.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.400
They’re together now.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.240
I think we’ve lost our chance, brother.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.160
Brother Banjong.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.880
What do you think?

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.040
Say something.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.480
If they’ve already decided
to be together.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.760
What more is there to say?

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.440
Eat, brother.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.240
Hey.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.600
Kosol, where are you going?

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.760
I’m going to see Banjong.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.040
Hey, stop right there.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.600
Haven’t I told you already?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.120
There’s nothing between me and Banjong.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.360
And I’ve already left his house.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.120
You really love to overreact.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.680
Worradej.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.400
Come ride with me.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.280
You’re asking me to ride horses?

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.960
What’s with you today?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.800
Come on, please.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.040
Weird.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.760
Really weird.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.080
Normally, if I hesitated.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.280
You’d just grab me
and throw me on the horse.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.560
Why are you talking so sweet today?

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.440
Super suspicious.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.320
Well, isn’t this how you like me?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.240
Beautiful, right?

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.000
Yeah, beautiful.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.560
Hey, Kosol.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.040
Why did you suddenly
take me horseback riding today?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.640
I want to apologize to you
for everything.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.800
Everything? There’s a lot.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.840
Well, all of it.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.520
For all the times I hurt you.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800
For making you unhappy.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.200
You were right.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.560
I shouldn’t have treated you badly.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.440
Or anyone else.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.920
Using my love as an excuse.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.560
I’m truly sorry, Worradej.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.000
I’m glad.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
That today you let go of your pride.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.960
At first,

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.760
I thought you were a stubborn straight man.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.880
One who never admits he’s wrong.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.480
But...

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.480
if today you’re willing to apologize.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.600
Then I’ll forgive you.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.880
Since we love each other now.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.320
I don’t want you to be hurt.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.720
Anything I can do for you.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.720
I want to do it.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.160
You know,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.000
you’re cuter than I thought, Kosol.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.840
Then...

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.720
I’ll give you a reward in return.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.960
Who is it?

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.200
Didn’t I say to knock before coming in?

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.480
Kosol.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.600
I went to pick up the pieces
of your glasses.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.040
And took them to a craftsman
to fix for you.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.520
Is that clear enough?

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.800
Crystal.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.400
I see everything clearly now.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.200
From now on.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.480
I won’t stand in the way.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.840
Between you and Worradej again.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.280
Thank you so much.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.880
Ow, my wound!

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.640
It’s been a while
since the battle ended.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.480
The wounded are recovering.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.720
But the villagers are still shaken.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.200
So I thought we should hold a festival.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.120
Bring back joy and life to everyone.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.840
I agree, Your Majesty.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.320
The full moon of the twelfth month
is only days away.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.080
I suggest we hold the festival then,
Your Majesty.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.840
The full moon of the twelfth month?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.360
That’s perfect.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.920
A night under the full moon.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.280
Bright enough, no torches needed.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.640
Cool breeze, perfect for strolling.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.200
Worradej.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.400
I’ll appoint you to lead this festival.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.200
I humbly accept, Your Majesty.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.360
Everyone, let’s make this celebration.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.880
as epic and fabulous as possible!

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.160
Count Somdet.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.560
Our scouts report that,

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.680
Singhanakhon plans a grand festival
on the twelfth full moon.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.560
It’s said to be quite the event.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.960
Hey, Kosol.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.600
After all this time, it still looks
like a lump of dung.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.480
When will it ever be finished?

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.120
Can’t you be patient?

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.680
This is my first time.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.840
Give me a break.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.320
Your first time?

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.000
And this is the best you can do?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.560
We’re making a water jar.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.880
Not some random pot.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.440
This looks like an incense burner.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.320
Here, look at the sample. See?

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.760
Hold it closer.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.160
I’m working on it!

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.440
Before it gets tall, it has to start low.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.440
And if you hadn’t come up
with this idea.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.600
We wouldn’t be struggling
like this now.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.400
In past festivals.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.680
We lit lanterns and lamps
along homes and city walls.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.560
As offerings to the sacred.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.440
But if this year we want the villagers
to gather at the pond.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.920
We need a reason to draw them there.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.760
How about this,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.560
On the fifteenth night,
when the river is full.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.840
Invite people to honor
the Goddess of Water.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.880
By floating krathongs
as sacred offerings.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.240
Oh my!

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.160
Am I witnessing another key moment
in history?

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.320
Is this the birth
of the Loy Krathong Festival?

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.320
I agree, Your Majesty.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.880
It’s chic to have an activity
everyone can join.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.960
But I worry about the waste, Your Majesty.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.280
For now, our population is small.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.680
But hundreds of years from now.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.360
As numbers grow.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.360
So will the waste.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.800
Instead of pleasing the Goddess.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.800
It might sadden her.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.760
You think far ahead, Worradej.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.000
And what would you suggest?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.400
I think,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.000
have people bring clean water
from their homes.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.640
And pour it back into the river.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.880
That way, no trash.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.240
The water stays pure,
the fish unharmed.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.240
The Goddess will be happy.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.720
And how will people
carry water from home?

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.640
With their hands?

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.320
Each person could,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.840
make their own clay vessel
to hold the water.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.240
Offering it to the Goddess
with utmost respect.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.600
Isn’t that good?

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.640
You think people can all
make pottery themselves?

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.000
That sounds troublesome.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.280
I don’t agree.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.720
It’s just pottery.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.720
- Not that hard to make.
- Let’s vote.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.400
Who sides with Worradej?

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.760
Raise your hand.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.120
See? In the end,
I’m the one stuck with it.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.440
Fine, forget it.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.840
Just sit still. I’ll do it myself.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.160
How hard can it be?

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.520
It’s just making a clay water jar.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.120
See? It’s not easy at all.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.640
It’s harder than it looks.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.600
Let me do it, you just sit still.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.800
No, you sit still. I’ll do it.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.880
Move your hand.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.400
You move yours.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.040
If I leave it to you,

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.040
it won’t be done even by next year.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.280
- Just stay put.
- I’ll mold it, give it here.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.760
Let go. No, you let go.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.880
No.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.920
I’ll do it myself.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.840
You just stay still.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.920
Hey, Kosol.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.640
The villagers are really cooperative.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.760
Look, jars everywhere,
ready for water.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.520
Hey, Worradej.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.280
Can you carry the jar for me?
I’m embarrassed.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.120
What’s there to be embarrassed about?

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.480
This is the jar we both,

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.560
worked on together. You should be proud.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.960
If you’re proud, you carry it.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.520
Is this a water jar
or a rotten gourd?

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.520
Why is it so lopsided?

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.920
Still, even if it’s ugly,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.240
No matter how crooked it looks,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.680
we should see it
like it’s our child.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.480
However our child may look,

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.400
we’d still love them.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.320
So you carry it.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.800
It’s so pretty, oh!

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.800
Why’d you stop walking,
P’Banjong?

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.200
What is it?

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.440
Pandao.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.160
Let’s take another way.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.160
No, Brother.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.320
We can’t keep avoiding each other.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.680
We’ll have to face it eventually.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.880
If it’s at work with others around,
I can handle it.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.320
But meeting you like this,

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.640
I don’t know what to do. Let me go.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.800
Why do you always run from problems?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.120
With me, you’re not allowed
to run anywhere.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.680
Let me go now, Pandao.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.160
That’s Banjong with Pandao.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.320
P’Banjong! P’Banjong!

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.680
Where’d Banjong go, Pandao?

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.600
He had a bad stomachache
and excused himself.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.440
Pandao, please hold this.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.040
I’ll come get it later.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.280
Kosol, where are you going?

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.560
- Wait for me, Kosol!
- Worradej! Worradej!

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.080
Hey, whoa!

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.600
Ow!

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.880
This thing is so heavy.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.800
Why are you following me?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.040
Are you crying?

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.040
No.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.440
Smoke just got in my eyes.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.160
Banjong.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.760
As your friend,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.400
I think you should face the truth.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.280
And stop running from it.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.880
I know it may hurt.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.600
But if it hurts and ends.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.400
It’s better than denying it
and hurting forever.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.520
If you want to cry,
just let it out.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.040
Men can cry too.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.760
There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.360
No more tears now, right?

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.880
Feeling lighter?

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.400
No more tears, okay?

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.680
Now if you’ve got something to say,
say it.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.080
I promise I’ll listen.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.240
And I won’t judge you.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.120
Worradej.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.680
The truth is,

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.200
I’ve loved you for so long.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800
That day you confessed your love,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.560
you have no idea how much it hurt

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.040
when I had to turn you down.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.880
But now today,

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.640
the day I want to say yes,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.040
it’s already too late.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.320
I know you two are together now.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.560
And I’m happy for you.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.440
For your love.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.360
But I just can’t let go yet.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.640
If I had said yes back then,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.120
I wouldn’t be crying today.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.880
But time,

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.880
it’s changed the me back then

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.400
into someone else today.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.880
So don’t waste any regret on me.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.320
There are so many people still waiting
for your love.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.640
Even the other day,

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.160
I still found myself charmed by you.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.000
You’re just so adorable, so sweet.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.280
Impossible not to like.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.400
Thank you, Banjong.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.640
For stepping aside for me.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.840
But I don’t want our friendship
to be lost.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.600
Can you still be friends with us again?

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.560
Of course.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.480
But give me some time.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.440
The wound is still fresh.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.960
There, there.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.040
Hey, it’s okay, Banjong.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.400
Don’t cry anymore.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.680
Kosol, come hug him quick.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.280
Our friend’s crying here.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.000
There, there.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.400
Hup.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.280
It’s okay, really.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.720
If you keep holding me like this,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.320
I’ll just cry harder.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.200
This year, under the full moon
of the twelfth month,

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.840
I’m honored to fight alongside you all
in Singhanakhon.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.720
Your Majesty.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.920
- King Chaiyached’s been shot.
- Chaiyached!

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.600
King Chaiyached has now passed away.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.640
The throne cannot be left empty.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.880
Hey, Kosol.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.960
What’s your plan for storming
the Grand Palace?

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.440
I heard that,

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.520
They’re gathering troops
from four towns.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.440
Then meeting at Pak Nam Inthu.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.360
Kosol, what are you doing?

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.560
Bathing you, of course.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.640
- Banjong, you sly fox.
- What are you doing?

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.280
(Actually sweet)
If I seem fierce, I’m not really.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.160
Sorry I’m not fierce enough.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.200
(Actually fierce)
Because I’m fierce in real life.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.680
I’ll give you a reward in return.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.560
Hey, careful.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.360
(That was close, Count)
Lean back.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.520
Almost fell backwards.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.840
(Count, keep it cool)

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.040
- Ouch, digging in.
- My hands are shaking.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.040
(Shaking hard)
Gripping the seat so tight.
