Are you nervous?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.200
To be honest,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.640
I am.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.430
Alright.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.710
Then let the groom

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.480
hold onto that feeling

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.740

you dare do it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.580
but won't admit it, right?

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.060
Sir.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.620
What brings you here?

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.900
Today's your wedding day.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.020
Of course I had to come
and give you a proper gift.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.940
Out of respect

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.460
for your long friendship with my dad,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.060
I honor you as an elder.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.580
But the gift really isn't necessary.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500
And what if I say this gift

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.580
is about the truth
behind Starlight Jewelry

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.860

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.980

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.540
that for Starlight Jewelry
to end up where it is today,

for your father's life's work
to be destroyed,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.700
the real mastermind behind it all

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.700
is the man you're about to marry,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.620

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.380
No way.

Don't believe me?

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.860
Think about it.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.020
Who really controls

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.700
the lifeblood of the core team
of Starlight Jewelry?

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.700
I don't know

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.620
who controls that.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.620
But I do know that Starlight Jewelry

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.900
was driven to this state

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.900
because of you.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.020
Because of me?

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.460
It seems you've

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.860
deeply misunderstood me.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.100
That's right.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.060
I did pressure your father
to hand over his shares.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.660
It was to get Starlight Group
listed sooner.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.860
But did you know?

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.300
Ji Baijian had been setting things up
behind the scenes all along!

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.900
He was waiting for Starlight Jewelry

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.980
to fall into crisis

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.700
so he could swoop in!

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.940
Under the guise of fund investment,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.500
he transferred
the entire core team away,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.540
leaving Starlight Jewelry

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.180
an empty shell.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.620
Establishing Zhifu Jewelry

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.220
was something Ji Baijian and I
agreed on together.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.180
If you're driving a wedge between us

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.180
with this,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.460
it's just childish.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.460
You say I'm driving a wedge?

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.580
Here.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.140
Listen for yourself.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.460
How could he possibly

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.740
agree to marry his daughter

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.700
to your son?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.300
So I think
your marriage alliance is fake.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.620
Your real goal

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.420
is to get revenge
for what happened back then, right?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.860
But when I set my sights on something,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.820
I don't let go easily.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.700
I suggest you don't ruin my plans.

Just recently,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.100
he discovered those rough gemstones

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.660
were in your family's warehouse.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.140
So now,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.660
he's using this marriage alliance

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.900
as a way to get revenge on your family.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.020

I don't know.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.420
As for Ji Baijian,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.820
he's always suspected your father

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.540
was involved in his mother's death.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.740
He's been meticulously planning all this

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.980
to take everything from your father.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.820
Impossible.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.340
Absolutely impossible.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.380

for company General Manager,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.460

how he could possibly come up

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.420

in such a short time?

Go ahead.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.820
I want to know the whole truth
about the rough gemstones.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.300
Fine.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.740
Then I'll

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.420

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.460
that happened back then.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.580
Those rough gemstones

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.740
appeared in my warehouse.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.740
But it wasn't my doing.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.980
I was framed.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.820
And the person who wanted to frame me

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.060
placed those rough gemstones

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.620
in my warehouse!

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.540
Back then,

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.700
when the scandal

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.420
about Dafu Jewelry
swapping high-quality stones

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.900
for inferior ones broke out,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.660
I had no idea they were in my warehouse.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.020
By the time I found out,

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.740
your mother

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.940
had already taken her own life
because of this.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.100
If I had come forward then,

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.300
I'd have had no way to clear my name.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.700
Yes.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.780
I investigated in Italy too.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.420
The rough gemstones were picked up
by an Asian man.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.820
Paid in cash.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.660
I got the transaction records.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.660
There was
no signature of yours on them...

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.940
But those gemstones

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.700
did end up in my warehouse.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.420
I never dared to touch or sell

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.940
those gemstones.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.300
I've always kept them in the warehouse.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.060
To avoid drawing attention,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.420
I even listed them as inferior quality.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.580
Some time ago,

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.540
Yi Wenhan developed a low-end series

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.620
and used those gemstones.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.780
When I found out,

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.540
I immediately
called off this product line

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.780
and sealed up all the bulk goods!

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.340
Baijian,

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.620
I really didn't swap
your family's rough gemstones.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.060
Yes, Dafu Jewelry's downfall

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.540
helped Starlight Jewelry rise.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.580
But I

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.060
am not that kind of vile man!

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.620
I can swear to you.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.620
If I had anything to do
with your family's gemstones,

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.140
may I rot in the grave!

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.460
Then tell me,

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.660
who was it that framed you?

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.660
If you know anything,

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.820
you must tell me.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.300
For our sake,

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.260
and for Zhizhi's.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.660
I have no proof,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.540
but the person who benefited the most

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.340
from that incident

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.220
was the chairman of Starlight Group,

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.620
Ye Taiting.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.460
Baijian.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.020

please

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.260
don't hurt Zhizhi

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.420
because of this.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.620
Don't worry.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.260
It was entirely my own decision

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.860
to be with Zhizhi

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.300
and marry her.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.540
Zhizhi.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.500
How did you know I was here?

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.740
I just saw your father.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.780
We talked everything through
about what happened back then.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.220
Whether you want to hear it or not,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.180
I need to explain.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.340
Fine.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.820
Go ahead.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.820
I'd love to hear

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.940
what excuse you've come up with.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.500
Here's the thing.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.980
My mother designed
a piece of jewelry back then,

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.700
but the rough gemstones were swapped.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.020
When the scandal broke
about the inferior stones,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.580
she was bombarded
with a torrent of abuse.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.140
My mother's death

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.140
made my father furious.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.100
He vowed to find the culprit

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.100
and get revenge.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.020
So he wanted me to use
the arranged marriage

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.060
to investigate your family.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.420
I... I'd been living abroad.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.780
I didn't know you.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.620
So when he asked me, I agreed.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.860

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.900
how could they ever outsmart you?

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:44.700
By the way, Mr. Ye,

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.940
I just got some news.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.700
The Italian jewelry brand, Drizzt,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.460
is preparing to enter the China market.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.900
They're recruiting agents in China
for the first time.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.160
[Drizzt China Market
Agent Recruitment RFP]

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.620
Drizzt is a major international brand.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.380
If we can partner with them,

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.860
all our current problems

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.420
will be solved.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.700
Are there any difficulties

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.980
in acquiring their agency rights?

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.580
There are some challenges.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.180
From what I know,

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.300
their requirements
for the China agency partnership

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.980
involve significant capital.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.180
And the public tender
is in just ten days.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.500
Securing the Drizzt agency rights

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.460
is crucial for us.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.340
So, I want you
to raise the capital immediately,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.340
at all costs!

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.180
Understood.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.300
Also, Mr. Ye,

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.740
now that the marriage

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.220
between Song Zhizhi
and Ji Baijian is off,

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.900
there's one person

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.260
we can use to our advantage.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.020
Who?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.740
Wei Ziming.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.580
Actually, the Song family

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.940
knew exactly what was on his mind.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.860
But he never dares to confess.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.740
It all came down to his background.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.740
Plus, Song Zhizhi

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.980
only sees him as a brother.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:12.940
So,

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.500
he just endures it silently.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.740
I see.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.340
He needs a title.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.500
Mr. Wei,

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.620
I thought you weren't going to come.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.300
Just say what you mean.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.380
What do you want from me?

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.740
Mr. Wei, be patient.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.540
Actually, I've been looking
for an opportunity

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.780
to talk with you.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.580
Right now, Starlight Jewelry

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:07.900
is losing employees.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.220
With your talent,

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.420
only being

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.780
a Deputy General Manager there

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.140
is a waste.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.660
I was wondering
if you'd like to join our group?

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.340
Mr. Ye

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.700
would value you highly

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.100
and offer you

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.140
a much better platform for development.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.540
After all,

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.700
Starlight Jewelry and Starlight Group

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.300
are on completely different scales.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.620
Mr. Qian, you should know

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.660
the only reason I stay

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.300
at Starlight Jewelry
is out of gratitude to the Song family.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.260
As for the status
and position you mentioned,

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.740
they hold no appeal for me.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.420
But you

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.900
don't carry the Song name.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.500
What have you gained from them
besides a chance

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.820
to repay the favor?

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.260
You can't even confess your feelings

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.420
to the person you love.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.780
But if you join our group,

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.740

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.740
With that status,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.300
you can rightfully fight
